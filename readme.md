# NewLens - Unsupervised News Article Analyzer

An end-to-end Single point NLP interfrace that analyzes any news article using unsupervised techniques to extract insights such as linguistic statistics, named entities, summaries, and similar articles — all wrapped inside a user-friendly frontend.

This project demonstrates practical NLP skills, ML engineering practices, and system design thinking, making it suitable for Data Scientist / ML Engineer entry-level roles.

### 🚀 Project Overview

Given a large news article, the system performs:
1. Text heuristics & linguistic analysis
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER) & keyword extraction
3. Abstractive text summarization
4. Semantic similarity search to find related articles
5. Interactive visualization through a web UI

## 🎯 Key Features
#### 🔍 Text Heuristics
- Word count
- Character count
- Sentence count
- Unique word ratio
- Lexical diversity
- Average sentence length

#### 🏷️ Entity & Keyword Extraction
1. Extracts:
- Persons
- Organizations
- Locations (GPE)
2. Stores entities in sets for future matching

3. Enables downstream similarity & analytics

#### ✂️ Text Summarization
* Generates ~100 word summaries
* Handles long documents via chunking
* Uses transformer-based pre-trained models

#### 🔗 Similar Article Retrieval
- Converts articles into vector embeddings
- Computes semantic similarity
- Returns Top-3 most similar articles from a large corpus
- Independent of article category labels

#### 🧠 Engineering Best Practices
- Centralized logging
- Custom exception handling
- Config-driven parameters
- Input validation
- Reproducible experiments

##### Note:
> “Different components of the system are trained or fine-tuned on datasets appropriate to their task. This mirrors real-world NLP systems, where models are specialized and pretrained on task-specific corpora. Care was taken to maintain consistent preprocessing and domain alignment to avoid distributional bias.”
