         "tv future in the hands of viewers with home theatre systems  plasma high-definition tvs  and digital video recorders moving into the living room  the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years  time.  that is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. with the us leading the trend  programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks  through cable  satellite  telecoms companies  and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.  one of the most talked-about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders (dvr and pvr). these set-top boxes  like the us s tivo and the uk s sky+ system  allow people to record  store  play  pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want.  essentially  the technology allows for much more personalised tv. they are also being built-in to high-definition tv sets  which are big business in japan and the us  but slower to take off in europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. not only can people forward wind through adverts  they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules  putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as  brand identity  and viewer loyalty to channels. although the us leads in this technology at the moment  it is also a concern that is being raised in europe  particularly with the growing uptake of services like sky+.  what happens here today  we will see in nine months to a years  time in the uk   adam hume  the bbc broadcast s futurologist told the bbc news website. for the likes of the bbc  there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. it is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial uk broadcasters  but brand loyalty is important for everyone.  we will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands   said tim hanlon  from brand communications firm starcom mediavest.  the reality is that with broadband connections  anybody can be the producer of content.  he added:  the challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice.   what this means  said stacey jolna  senior vice president of tv guide tv group  is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers. it means that networks  in us terms  or channels could take a leaf out of google s book and be the search engine of the future  instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. this kind of channel model might work for the younger ipod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. but it might not suit everyone  the panel recognised. older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands  mr hanlon suggested.  on the other end  you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them   said mr hanlon.  ultimately  the consumer will tell the market they want.   of the 50 000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces  many of them are about enhancing the tv-watching experience. high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd (liquid crystal display) tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them  instead of being external boxes. one such example launched at the show is humax s 26-inch lcd tv with an 80-hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder. one of the us s biggest satellite tv companies  directtv  has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100-hours of recording capability  instant replay  and a search function. the set can pause and rewind tv for up to 90 hours. and microsoft chief bill gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with tivo  called tivotogo  which means people can play recorded programmes on windows pcs and mobile devices. all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want  when they want."

         "tigers wary of farrell  gamble  leicester say they will not be rushed into making a bid for andy farrell should the great britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes.   we and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage   tigers boss john wells told bbc radio leicester.  at the moment  there are still a lot of unknowns about andy farrell  not least his medical situation.  whoever does take him on is going to take a big  big gamble.  farrell  who has had persistent knee problems  had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months. leicester and saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing farrell if he decides to move to the 15-man game.  if he does move across to union  wells believes he would better off playing in the backs  at least initially.  i m sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre   said wells.  i think england would prefer him to progress to a position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards.  the jury is out on whether he can cross that divide.  at this club  the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in a ready-made replacement."

         "2 escaped murder suspects arrested at US-Mexico border",
         "Authorities are trying to determine if anyone helped two inmates who escaped from a California jail, traveled hundreds of miles and crossed into Mexico before being captured trying to walk back into the United States.&#10;&#10;Jonathan Salazar, 20, and Santos Fonseca, 21, were arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials at a port of entry in San Ysidro — the nation's largest border crossing — early Wednesday, Monterey County Sheriff's Office Capt. John Thornburg said.&#10;&#10;Thornburg said the two are in the custody of Monterey County officials and have been returned to a jail in Salinas, a farming city of about 160,000 people roughly 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of San Francisco.&#10;&#10;Salazar and Fonseca escaped Sunday from the lockup in Salinas after climbing through a hole they made in the ceiling of a bathroom, squeezing through a hollow wall and kicking open a hatch. Officials found their jail-issued jumpsuits outside the building. Inmates often wear their own clothes under the jumpsuits, Thornburg said.&#10;&#10;Investigators have not yet determined how long they worked on making the hole or if anyone else helped them escape or helped them after they were out. They were reported missing at 8:15 a.m. Sunday.&#10;&#10;Thornburg said authorities received a tip that the pair, both born and raised in Salinas, had been spotted in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, around 400 miles (644 kilometers) south of Monterey County, and alerted federal officials.&#10;&#10;CBP spokeswoman Jackie Wasiluk said the men didn't present any documents. They said they were U.S. citizens, and a check of law enforcement databases told border inspectors that they were wanted by authorities.&#10;&#10;How the pair made it to Mexico, why they decided to travel together since they allegedly belong to rival gangs and why they returned to the United States is under investigation, Thornburg said.&#10;&#10;\"The good news here is they are in custody again,\" Thornburg said.&#10;&#10;Salazar and Fonseca will be housed separately in a different housing unit from the one they escaped, Thornburg said, adding that officials had already made security improvements to the jail. He said he couldn't provide details.&#10;&#10;Before being spotted in Tijuana, investigators received a credible tip from an employee at a motel in Marina about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the jail who told authorities Salazar had checked in there Tuesday morning, but authorities found no one in the room after a nearly eight-hour standoff, Thornburg said.&#10;&#10;\"It all looked like we had Mr. Salazar in a motel,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, last night he wasn't there.\"&#10;&#10;Both had been in custody since 2018 and were awaiting trial on murder counts and \"numerous other felony charges\" in separate cases.&#10;&#10;Salazar was arrested in the shooting death of 20-year-old Jaime Martinez as the victim drove in Salinas with his girlfriend and 18-month-old son. The woman was shot and treated at a hospital, while the child wasn't hurt.&#10;&#10;Police investigated the Oct. 12, 2017, shooting as gang-related. Officers said his tattoos, including the letter P on his cheek, refer to his Sureño offshoot gang, La Posada Trece, the Californian reported. His trial was scheduled to begin in January.&#10;&#10;Fonseca told police after his arrest on homicide charges that his gang leader told him to kill someone to prove he was still loyal to the Boronda Boys, a subset of the Norteño gang, Detective Gabriela Contreras testified.&#10;&#10;Fonseca is charged with shooting Lorenzo Gomez Acosta, 37, to death on June 2, 2018, while the victim sat in his car on a video call with his wife in Mexico, the Californian reported.&#10;&#10;She saw a scuffle, heard her husband screaming \"no\" and then gunshots rang out, Salinas police Officer Froylan Aranda said. Acosta was reportedly chosen at random.&#10;&#10;Three days later, Fonseca shot and killed Ernesto Garcia Cruz, 27, in a Salinas park, authorities said. He told police that the gang leader also ordered the slaying and that he picked his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend \"to send him a message,\" Contreras said.&#10;&#10;Associated Press journalist Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.",

         "2 escaped murder suspects arrested at US-Mexico border",
         "Authorities are trying to determine if anyone helped two inmates who escaped from a California jail, traveled hundreds of miles and crossed into Mexico before being captured trying to walk back into the United States.&#10;&#10;Jonathan Salazar, 20, and Santos Fonseca, 21, were arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials at a port of entry in San Ysidro — the nation's largest border crossing — early Wednesday, Monterey County Sheriff's Office Capt. John Thornburg said.&#10;&#10;Thornburg said the two are in the custody of Monterey County officials and have been returned to a jail in Salinas, a farming city of about 160,000 people roughly 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of San Francisco.&#10;&#10;Salazar and Fonseca escaped Sunday from the lockup in Salinas after climbing through a hole they made in the ceiling of a bathroom, squeezing through a hollow wall and kicking open a hatch. Officials found their jail-issued jumpsuits outside the building. Inmates often wear their own clothes under the jumpsuits, Thornburg said.&#10;&#10;Investigators have not yet determined how long they worked on making the hole or if anyone else helped them escape or helped them after they were out. They were reported missing at 8:15 a.m. Sunday.&#10;&#10;Thornburg said authorities received a tip that the pair, both born and raised in Salinas, had been spotted in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, around 400 miles (644 kilometers) south of Monterey County, and alerted federal officials.&#10;&#10;CBP spokeswoman Jackie Wasiluk said the men didn't present any documents. They said they were U.S. citizens, and a check of law enforcement databases told border inspectors that they were wanted by authorities.&#10;&#10;How the pair made it to Mexico, why they decided to travel together since they allegedly belong to rival gangs and why they returned to the United States is under investigation, Thornburg said.&#10;&#10;\"The good news here is they are in custody again,\" Thornburg said.&#10;&#10;Salazar and Fonseca will be housed separately in a different housing unit from the one they escaped, Thornburg said, adding that officials had already made security improvements to the jail. He said he couldn't provide details.&#10;&#10;Before being spotted in Tijuana, investigators received a credible tip from an employee at a motel in Marina about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the jail who told authorities Salazar had checked in there Tuesday morning, but authorities found no one in the room after a nearly eight-hour standoff, Thornburg said.&#10;&#10;\"It all looked like we had Mr. Salazar in a motel,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, last night he wasn't there.\"&#10;&#10;Both had been in custody since 2018 and were awaiting trial on murder counts and \"numerous other felony charges\" in separate cases.&#10;&#10;Salazar was arrested in the shooting death of 20-year-old Jaime Martinez as the victim drove in Salinas with his girlfriend and 18-month-old son. The woman was shot and treated at a hospital, while the child wasn't hurt.&#10;&#10;Police investigated the Oct. 12, 2017, shooting as gang-related. Officers said his tattoos, including the letter P on his cheek, refer to his Sureño offshoot gang, La Posada Trece, the Californian reported. His trial was scheduled to begin in January.&#10;&#10;Fonseca told police after his arrest on homicide charges that his gang leader told him to kill someone to prove he was still loyal to the Boronda Boys, a subset of the Norteño gang, Detective Gabriela Contreras testified.&#10;&#10;Fonseca is charged with shooting Lorenzo Gomez Acosta, 37, to death on June 2, 2018, while the victim sat in his car on a video call with his wife in Mexico, the Californian reported.&#10;&#10;She saw a scuffle, heard her husband screaming \"no\" and then gunshots rang out, Salinas police Officer Froylan Aranda said. Acosta was reportedly chosen at random.&#10;&#10;Three days later, Fonseca shot and killed Ernesto Garcia Cruz, 27, in a Salinas park, authorities said. He told police that the gang leader also ordered the slaying and that he picked his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend \"to send him a message,\" Contreras said.&#10;&#10;Associated Press journalist Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.",

         "\"One family member said Derek “can be violent and has attacked Rex in the past,” court documents stated. The family member also said Derek’s mother had died years ago and Rex was taking care of him alone.\" &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;This grisly story offers another side to the shiny, happy portrayal of autism during the month of April. A Spokane, Washington widowed physician, age 61, was found brutally murdered and his 29 year old, preverbal autistic son living amid squalor. It appears that the son is at least, a suspect. If not, he is also a victim, left alone in the home without life skills.  Either version is a far cry from what we're spoon fed about autism. This kind of tragic story is going to repeat itself over and over, like the stories of autistic children wandering and drowning. Parents will age. Strong adult men (and women) with autism will rage. The future may be bleak and harsh. Meanwhile, we're told we are \"allowed\" to seek awareness, but not cure or even true treatment. Our loved ones must suffer a lifetime of... autism.  God bless Dr. Rex Porter and his son Derek. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;###&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Detectives are investigating the death of a retired Spokane anesthesiologist whose body was found dismembered and burned in the backyard of his Dishman Hills area home.&#10;&#10;The victim, Dr. Rex C. Porter, 61, previously worked for Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center. He was the caretaker of his son, Derek C. Porter, 29, who is autistic and nonverbal, according to court documents. They lived on an 11-acre property in the 2800 block of South Park Lane near the Iller Creek Conservation Area.&#10;&#10;On Saturday, a neighbor called 911 to report that Porter’s car had been sitting in the driveway for two days with a door open. A garage door had been left open, too.&#10;&#10;Spokane County Sheriff’s deputies responded Sunday to the house for a welfare check, according to a search warrant filed Tuesday in Spokane County Superior Court.&#10;&#10;Deputies reported seeing the house in disarray as they looked through the windows, including broken glass on the floor. Attempts to call Rex Porter were unsuccessful, prompting deputies to enter the house. They smelled a strong odor they believed to be animal feces, according to court documents.&#10;&#10;Deputies continued their search downstairs to the basement and found more glass, along with blood and damaged items. They opened a door and “suddenly an adult male was standing in front of them with only shorts and a T-shirt,” according to court documents.&#10;&#10;Deputies detained the individual, believing he was squatting in the house, according to court records.&#10;&#10;In the bathroom, the toilet was full of feces and the sink held what deputies thought was the remains of a dead animal, court records stated....  Read more at Spokesman.com",

         "US: White officer charged with murder in shooting of black woman",
         "A white police officer who shot and killed an African American woman in her Fort Worth, Texas, home in the presence of her eight-year-old nephew was charged with murder on Monday after resigning from the force.&#10;&#10;The Fort Worth Police Department said its officers were responding to a call from a neighbour, who reported to a non-emergency line, that Atatiana Jefferson's front door had been left open. The responding officer fired a shot through a window, killing 28-year-old Jefferson.&#10;&#10;Interim Police Chief Ed Kraus said at a news conference on Monday that the officer, Aaron Dean, resigned. He said if Dean had not stepped down, he would have been fired, adding that the officer acted inappropriately.&#10;&#10;The family had called for Dean's arrest.&#10;&#10;In a statement released over the weekend, Fort Worth police said officers saw someone near a window inside the home and that one of them drew his duty weapon and fired after \"perceiving a threat\". The body camera video released by police shows two officers searching the home from the outside with flashlights before one shouts, \"Put your hands up, show me your hands.\" One shot is then fired through a window.&#10;&#10;In the video, the officer does not identify himself as police.&#10;&#10;\"Nobody looked at this video and said that there's any doubt that this officer acted inappropriately,\" Kraus said.&#10;&#10;\"I feel like we had some failures here,\" Fort Worth Police Officers Association President Manny Ramirez told reporters after the news conference. \"It never should have happened.\"&#10;&#10;Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price called for \"justice and closure\" for Jefferson's family.&#10;&#10;Earlier on Monday, family members described Jefferson as a smart, nurturing woman who recently moved in with her mother to help care for her in her declining health. A sister, Ashley Carr, said Jefferson embodied, honour, integrity, commitment and service.&#10;&#10;\"Any neighbourhood would be proud to have her as a neighbour and any city would be proud to have her as a citizen,\" Carr said.&#10;&#10;A single bullet hole was visible in the window of the single-story, freshly painted purple home and floral tributes and stuffed animals piled up in the street outside Jefferson's home.&#10;&#10;According to a demographics report released by the Fort Worth Police Department, nearly two-thirds of its 1,100 officers were white, as of June 30. Just over 20 percent were Hispanic or Latino and about 10 percent were black.&#10;&#10;Relations with the public have been strained after other recent Fort Worth police shootings. In June, the department released body camera footage of officers fatally shooting a man who ignored repeated orders to drop his handgun. He was the fourth person Fort Worth police had fired upon in 10 days.&#10;&#10;Ed Kraus took over as interim police chief in the city in May after the previous chief was fired.&#10;&#10;The Fort Worth Police Officers Association issued a statement on Sunday calling for \"a thorough and transparent investigation\" into the shooting.&#10;&#10;Fort Worth police said it released the bodycam footage soon after the shooting for transparency, but that any \"camera footage inside the residence\" could not be distributed due to state law.&#10;&#10;The bodycam video included blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom. It is unclear if the firearm was found near Jefferson, and police have not said that the officer who shot her thought she was holding a gun. The police statement released Saturday said only that officers who entered the residence after the shooting found a firearm, and Lieutenant Brandon O'Neil would not answer reporters' questions Sunday on why police released images of the gun.&#10;&#10;O'Neil said the officer would meet with investigators from the Fort Worth Police Department on Monday about the shooting. Police previously said the officer, a white man, joined the department in April 2018.&#10;&#10;A large crowd gathered outside Jefferson's home Sunday night for a vigil after earlier demonstrations briefly stopped traffic on part of Interstate 35.&#10;&#10;Jefferson was a 2014 graduate of Xavier University in New Orleans and earned a bachelor's degree in biology, the university said. Merritt told the Star-Telegram that Jefferson was working in pharmaceutical equipment sales and was considering going back to medical school.&#10;&#10;Nearly 700 killed by police in 2019&#10;&#10;Fort Worth is about 50km (30 miles) west of Dallas, where another high-profile police shooting occurred last year. In that case, white Dallas police officer Amber Guyger fatally shot her black neighbour Botham Jean inside his own apartment after Guyger said she mistook it for her own. Guyger, 31, was sentenced this month to 10 years in prison.&#10;&#10;In Georgia, a former white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed, naked, black man was found not guilty of murder on Monday.&#10;&#10;Jurors did convict Robert \"Chip\" Olsen of aggravated assault, violation of oath of office and making a false statement. Olsen's face turned red and he squeezed his eyes shut tightly when the verdict was red. His wife, Kathy Olsen, began sobbing and had to be led from the court.&#10;&#10;Olsen, now 57, was a DeKalb County police officer in March 2015 when he responded to a call of a naked man behaving erratically outside an Atlanta-area apartment complex. Shortly after arriving, he fatally shot 26-year-old Anthony Hill, an Air Force veteran who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.&#10;&#10;According to the Washington Post's Fatal Force database, at least 689 people have been killed by police in the US so far in 2019. At least 992 people were killed by the police in 2018 and more than 980 people were killed by police the previous year.&#10;&#10;According to watchdog group The Sentencing Project, African American men are six times more likely to be arrested than white men.&#10;&#10;These disparities, particularly the killing of African Americans by police, has prompted the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, a popular civil rights campaign aimed at ending police violence and dismantling structural racism.",

         "Australian police on Wednesday charged an officer with murder after widespread protests over the fatal shooting of a 19-year-old Aboriginal man in front of his family.&#10;&#10;The incident occurred on Saturday when police said they attempted to arrest Kumanjayi Walker for \"alleged property and assault police offences\" in the remote town of Yuendumu.&#10;&#10;According to the force's account, an altercation occurred and an officer who was stabbed in the shoulder \"discharged his firearm\".&#10;&#10;Walker later died at a police station, where his family alleged he was denied adequate medical treatment.&#10;&#10;\"A 28-year old male Northern Territory police officer has been charged with one count of murder,\" police said in a statement.&#10;&#10;Walker was the second Aboriginal person to die in police custody in as many months.&#10;&#10;His death prompted rallies across Australia after family members and activists called for a \"National Day of Action\" on Wednesday.&#10;&#10;\"We want justice for what they done, being shot in cold blood in front of the mother and wife,\" said Valerie Napaljarri Martin, a senior member of the same Warlpiri community as Walker.&#10;&#10;\"Our black lives matter,\" she said before the demonstrations. \"It's gone beyond too far.\"",

         "An Uber driver accused of killing six people at random in a shooting spree in the US state of Michigan in 2016 has pleaded guilty to murder, attempted murder and firearms offences.&#10;&#10;Four people were killed at a restaurant and two at a car dealership in the shootings in the city of Kalamazoo.&#10;&#10;Jason Dalton, 48, had initially blamed the app for controlling his \"mind and body\".&#10;&#10;But he changed his plea shortly before his trial was due to begin.&#10;&#10;No deal was offered to Mr Dalton for the guilty plea, prosecutors said.&#10;&#10;His charges consist of six counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and eight charges relating to firearms offences. He now faces a mandatory life sentence without parole.&#10;&#10;Mr Dalton, who submitted his plea while jury selection was taking place, did so despite the objections of his attorney.&#10;&#10;He told the judge at the Kalamazoo County court that he had made the decision of his own free will, adding that he had \"wanted this for quite a while\".&#10;&#10;Mr Dalton had earlier reportedly told police that he was made a \"puppet\" by the Uber application, which directed him to shoot people at random over a five-hour period in February 2016.&#10;&#10;Although none of the victims were Uber customers, police said Mr Dalton continued to pick up passengers during the shooting spree in Kalamazoo, a small city about 150 miles (241km) west of Detroit.&#10;&#10;The shootings took place on a Saturday evening at three locations - outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant, a Kia car dealership and an apartment block.&#10;&#10;Following his arrest that evening, Uber confirmed that Mr Dalton was a driver registered with the app-based cab-hailing company, issuing a statement saying that it was \"horrified and heartbroken\" at the violence.&#10;&#10;Mr Dalton had undergone background checks but passed because he had no criminal record, Uber said.",

         "Twenty-four shootings and five murders took place across Chicago over the weekend amid a spike in gun violence in the third-largest US city, police say.&#10;&#10;Two children were hurt when gunmen opened fire at a gathering on Saturday.&#10;&#10;The most recent fatal shooting occurred on Sunday morning. A 52-year-old man was found dead with a bullet wound to the head.&#10;&#10;Last year Chicago recorded 561 murders, more than the two biggest US cities - New York and Los Angeles - combined.&#10;&#10;There were 44 murders in Chicago in the first two months of 2019.&#10;&#10;The two children shot on Saturday were injured while attending a baby shower in the South Side. They are in a critical but stable condition.&#10;&#10;Police say the shooting could have \"stemmed from an ongoing gang conflict\" in the area.&#10;&#10;Later on Saturday, a 19-year-old man was shot dead in the south of the city as he was standing outside with a friend.&#10;&#10;Shots were fired at him from a vehicle, the Chicago Sun Times reported. The friend is said to be in a good condition.&#10;&#10;On Sunday morning, a 32-year-old man was shot in the back, also in the South Side. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.&#10;&#10;Last August, Chicago Police asked for more help to combat gun violence following a spate of shootings over one weekend.&#10;&#10;Chicago police say that as of 1 March, they had seized more than 1,600 illegal guns this year. The figures equate to one illegal gun taken off the street every 53 minutes.",

         "SALT LAKE CITY -- A man accused of killing a Utah college student was ordered Friday to stand trial on charges he sexually assaulted another woman he met on a dating site more than a year before the slaying.&#10;&#10;Ayoola Ajayi, 31, pleaded not guilty to felony kidnapping and three counts of forcible sexual abuse.&#10;&#10;Defense attorneys had asked to cross-examine the woman, saying there there were inconsistencies between her written testimony and initial statements to police, but Judge Venice Trease denied the request, citing victims' rights law.&#10;&#10;Ajayi, shackled and in a yellow jail uniform, hung his head as the judge read the order, The Deseret News reported.&#10;&#10;He met the woman on a dating app for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and invited her to his house for dinner in March 2018, prosecutors have said. He pinned her arms and assaulted her as they were watching television but she was able to get away, charges stated. She reported the crime after seeing news stories about 23-year-old Mackenzie Lueck, whom authorities say disappeared after meeting up with Ajayi in a park in June.&#10;&#10;Ajayi is charged with murder and kidnapping in the death of Lueck, a University of Utah student from California. Her charred body was later found with her arms bound behind her back.&#10;&#10;Ajayi was also charged with sexual exploitation of a minor after investigators discovered child pornography on his computer.&#10;&#10;He has not yet entered pleas to those charges, and his lawyers have not commented.",

         "SAN FRANCISCO -- A judge has ruled that a 29-year-old parolee with a history of mental illness is mentally fit to stand trial for the slaying of a woman on an Oakland subway platform.&#10;&#10;Alameda County Superior Court Judge James Cramer said Tuesday that John Lee Cowell will face trial starting in January for the unprovoked stabbing death of 18-year-old Nia Wilson in July 2018, KPIX-TV reported.&#10;&#10;Cowell has been charged with murder and attempted murder for the attack on Wilson and her sister, Letifah, 26, who was wounded in the attack.&#10;&#10;The trial had been in legal limbo as authorities sought to determine Cowell's mental competence. At a hearing Monday, Cramer said that Cowell was not cooperating with doctors appointed last month to evaluate him, for the latest in a series of evaluations. The judge said he understood Cowell has a history of mental illness but that doctors who had previously examined him felt he was “malingering”to avoid standing trial. The judge recessed the hearing, saying he needed 24 hours to reach his decision and announced his ruling Tuesday.&#10;&#10;Wilson's death was one of several violent or fatal attacks on Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) lines that connect San Francisco to the cities of Berkeley, Oakland and others.&#10;&#10;BART has announced new safety measures and installed thousands of security cameras as part of an effort to increase safety.&#10;&#10;Prosecutors have said they will seek a life sentence against Cowell and are investigating if he was motivated by racial hate when he killed Wilson.

         "The trial of a man accused of shooting dead four people at a Jewish museum in Belgium in 2014 has started in Brussels amid high security.&#10;&#10;Mehdi Nemmouche, 33, who was in court, faces a life sentence if convicted of the killings in the Belgian capital following his return from Syria where he allegedly fought alongside the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) fighters.&#10;&#10;Nemmouche's suspected accomplice in the May 24, 2014 attack, Nacer Bendrer, a fellow Frenchman aged 30, was also present in the Brussels courtroom on Thursday.&#10;&#10;Both have previously denied charges of \"terrorist murder\", the first of several attacks on European soil attributed to the ISIL.&#10;&#10;The shooting caused the death of four people: an Israeli couple, a Belgian man who worked at the museum and a French woman who volunteered there.&#10;&#10;Six days after the attack Nemmouche - born to a family of Algerian origin in the northern French town of Roubaix - was arrested in the southern French port city of Marseille, where he arrived on a bus from Brussels.&#10;&#10;Investigators said he was carrying a handgun and an assault rifle used in the shooting.&#10;&#10;They said he fought with an armed group in Syria from 2013 to 2014, where he met Najim Laachraoui, a member of the gang which went on to carry out suicide bombings in Brussels that killed 32 people in March 2016.&#10;&#10;The same Brussels cell is also alleged to have carried out the Paris gun attacks and bombings on November 13, 2015, in which 130 people were killed and hundreds more wounded.&#10;&#10;Both attacks were claimed by the ISIL group.&#10;&#10;Nemmouche and Bendrer, investigators say, met nearly a decade ago while in prison in southern France, where they were both described as \"radicalised\" inmates who tried to win others over.&#10;&#10;Bendrer was arrested in Marseille seven months after the Jewish museum attack and charged as Nemmouche's accomplice.&#10;&#10;Although he was jailed for five years in September by a French court for attempted extortion, he was transferred to Belgium for the trial.&#10;&#10;Nemmouche is expected to face a separate trial in France for holding French journalists hostage in Syria.",

         "The trial of Loujain al-Hathloul, one of nearly a dozen prominent Saudi Arabian women's rights activists jailed since last year, will begin on Wednesday, her family has said.&#10;&#10;Dozens of other activists, intellectuals and clerics have been arrested separately in the past two years in an apparent bid to stamp out opposition to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has consolidated power, including through a sweeping anti-corruption campaign.&#10;&#10;\"My sister @LoujainHathloul will be having her first trial session next Wednesday at 8am at the specialised court in Riyadh. This is the court [that] deals with terrorism cases,\" her brother Walid wrote on Sunday on Twitter.&#10;&#10;He said she was not allowed to have a lawyer and had not been provided with a list of indictments.&#10;&#10;The public prosecutor said last June that five men and four women had been arrested and held on suspicion of harming the country's interests and offering support to hostile elements abroad. Saudi media widely denounced them as traitors.&#10;&#10;It was unclear if the other detainees will also stand trial this week.&#10;&#10;Activists claim some detainees, including 29-year-old Hathloul, were held in solitary confinement and subjected to mistreatment and torture, including electric shocks, flogging, and sexual assault. Saudi officials have denied those allegations as \"false\".&#10;&#10;The arrests have intensified international criticism of Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul sparked global outrage.&#10;&#10;Three dozen countries, including all 28 European Union members, called on Riyadh last week to release the activists, the first rebuke of the kingdom at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) since it was set up in 2006.&#10;&#10;US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his British counterpart have also said they raised the issue with the Saudi authorities during recent visits.&#10;&#10;The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the public prosecutor's office said earlier this month it had completed its investigations of the detainees and was preparing their trials.&#10;&#10;Hathloul, who advocated an end to a ban on women driving and the kingdom's male guardianship system, was previously jailed for 73 days in 2014 after she attempted to drive into Saudi Arabia from the United Arab Emirates.&#10;&#10;The driving ban was lifted in June, weeks after she was rearrested. The guardianship system, which requires women to obtain the consent of a male relative for major decisions, remains intact.",

         "A couple from the US state of California have been sentenced to life in prison for starving and torturing all but one of their 13 children.&#10;&#10;David and Louise Turpin were arrested in January 2018 when their 17-year-old daughter escaped their home in the city of Perris and raised the alarm.&#10;&#10;The children had been abused for at least nine years and some were found chained up in filthy conditions.&#10;&#10;But several of the children told the court they had forgiven their parents.&#10;&#10;The couple are expected to serve the rest of their lives behind bars, unless they are granted parole in 25 years.&#10;&#10;The Turpins wept as they heard victim-impact statements from four of their children at Friday's hearing.&#10;&#10;One child recounted being haunted by the ordeal.&#10;&#10;I cannot describe in words what we went through growing up,\" said his statement.&#10;&#10;\"Sometimes I still have nightmares of things that had happened such as my siblings being chained up or getting beaten.&#10;&#10;\"That is the past and this is now.&#10;&#10;\"I love my parents and have forgiven them for a lot of the things they did to us.\"&#10;&#10;Another child, in a statement read by her brother, also forgave her parents for the abuse.&#10;&#10;\"I love both of my parents so much,\" she said.&#10;&#10;\"Although it may not have been the best way of raising us, I am glad that they did because it made me the person I am today.\"&#10;&#10;But not all the children were so conciliatory.&#10;&#10;One daughter, who was visibly shaking, said: \"My parents took my whole life from me, but now I'm taking my life back.&#10;&#10;\"I'm a fighter, I'm strong and I'm shooting through life like a rocket.\"&#10;&#10;She added: \"I saw my dad change my mom. They almost changed me, but I realised what was happening.\"&#10;&#10;David and Louise Turpin cried as they apologised for the treatment of their children.&#10;&#10;The 57-year-old father's lawyer read a prepared statement on his behalf, saying: \"My home schooling and discipline had good intentions.&#10;&#10;\"I never intended for any harm to come to my children. I love my children and I believe my children love me.\"&#10;&#10;He was an engineer for major US defence contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.&#10;&#10;Speaking directly to the court, housewife Louise Turpin, 50, said she was \"truly sorry\" for what she had done.&#10;&#10;\"I love my children so much,\" she said. \"I really look forward to the day I can see them, hug them and tell them I'm sorry.\"&#10;&#10;The couple sat stony-faced as the judge rebuked them for their \"selfish, cruel and inhuman treatment\".&#10;&#10;Judge Bernard Schwartz said: \"You have severed the ability to interact and raise your children that you have created and brought into this world.&#10;&#10;\"The only reason that your punishment is less than the maximum time in my opinion is because you accepted responsibility at an early stage in the proceeding.&#10;&#10;\"And you spared your children having to relive the humiliation and the harm they endured in that house of horrors.\"&#10;&#10;The tidy exterior of the middle-class family home 70 miles (112km) south of Los Angeles offered a veneer of respectability that masked the squalor and stench of human waste found by authorities within.&#10;&#10;The children, between the ages of two to 29 at the time of the police raid, were severely malnourished.&#10;&#10;A 22-year-old son was discovered chained to a bed. His two sisters had just been released from shackles.&#10;&#10;The victims were forbidden to shower more than once a year, were unable to use the toilet and none of them had ever seen a dentist.&#10;&#10;Some of the adult siblings' growth had been so severely stunted by starvation that authorities at first mistook them for children.&#10;&#10;Newly released audio of their daughter's call to 911, obtained by ABC, provides a hint of the conditions in which the children lived.&#10;&#10;\"Two of my sisters and one of my brothers... they're chained up to their bed\", the 17-year-old girl, who did not know her own address, told the emergency operator.&#10;&#10;\"Sometimes I wake up and I can't breathe because how dirty the house is.\"&#10;&#10;The girl was also unaware of the year or month, or the meaning of the word \"medication\".&#10;&#10;The children - whose names all begin with the letter J - were kept indoors, but were allowed out for Halloween, or on family trips to Disneyland and Las Vegas.&#10;&#10;About 20 people from across the country, including nurses and psychologists, have offered to care for the seven adult siblings and six children.",

         "The  in Hollywood continues to eat itself, as the politically correct culture is now being used to protect the public images of despots and dictators – as long as the price is right.&#10;&#10;One can only imagine what the threat, or promise of future cash was which prompted this latest censorship move by the vapid cultural gatekeepers at Netflix.&#10;&#10;Netflix has removed an episode of comedy show Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj for viewers in Saudi Arabia after the country complained about the host’s criticism of its war in Yemen and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.&#10;&#10;According to the FT, the streaming site confirmed it had removed the episode, which is described on the website as: “Hasan exposes grim truths about Saudi Arabia and the charismatic crown prince known as ‘MBS [Mohammed bin Salman].'”&#10;&#10;The decision followed a complaint made by Saudi Arabia’s Communications and Information Technology Commission on the grounds that the episode violated the anti-cyber crime law against “material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy”.&#10;&#10;Under Article 6 of Saudi Arabia’s anti-cyber crime law, “production, preparation, transmission, or storage” of such material “through the information network or computers” is punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a 3m Saudi riyal ($800,000) fine.&#10;&#10;In the episode, the comedian takes aim at the kingdom in the aftermath of Khashoggi’s assassination inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October.&#10;&#10;Both the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which he calls “the biggest tragedy of the MBS era”, and the crown prince himself come in for criticism. Minhaj calls for American ties to the oil-rich kingdom to be placed under the spotlight.&#10;&#10;“Now would be a good time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia. And I mean that as a Muslim, and as an American,” he says in the episode.&#10;&#10;Netflix defended the decision in a statement, saying: “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request – and to comply with local law.”&#10;&#10;The report has provoked a response from many prominent figures on social media.&#10;&#10;“Wow. When Netflix censors material on behalf of Mohammad bin Salman,” tweeted Iyad el-Baghdadi, a Norway-based human rights activist. “Many of us Arabs were very excited when Netflix launched its MENA division, because we thought this is a way in which we can bypass censorship. I guess there’s the end of that.”&#10;&#10;“Money always comes ahead of principles. Corporatism is a pillar of the structure of power that keeps us pinned down,” he added.&#10;&#10;Others on social media shared Baghdadi’s concern, wondering how much influence Mohammed bin Salman had over Netflix.",

         "Judge to consider delaying trial start in Parkland massacre",
         "The judge overseeing the case of Florida school shooting defendant Nikolas Cruz said Tuesday she will consider a defense request to delay the start of trial beyond late January.&#10;&#10;Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer set a Dec. 19 date for arguments on the motion by defense lawyers who claim the case is moving much too swiftly and runs the risk of legal errors. That could mean a conviction of Cruz might be reversed on appeal, sending it back for another high-profile trial.&#10;&#10;Prosecutors have been pushing hard to start the trial with jury selection beginning Jan. 27. Broward State Attorney Mike Satz, who is the chief prosecutor on the case, said the motion to delay trial must be heard quickly.&#10;&#10;“We just can't wait until the last minute,” Satz said at a hearing.&#10;&#10;Cruz, 21, faces 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the Valentine's Day 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He faces the death penalty if convicted, although his lawyers say he will plead guilty in return for a life prison sentence.&#10;&#10;In their motion, defense lawyers noted that of 38 capital punishment cases in Broward County since 1994, the average time they remained pending between arrest and trial was 52 months, or a little over four years.&#10;&#10;On the current schedule, Cruz's trial would begin less than two years after the mass shooting on Feb. 14, 2018. He was arrested that same day. Defense lawyers say that is far too fast for them to adequately prepare a defense in a case of such magnitude.&#10;&#10;“We want to make sure it's done once and it's done right,” said Gordon Weekes, chief assistant public defender in Broward County. “Expedience has taken precedence over the prudent disposition of this case.”&#10;&#10;The defense motion suggests that one reason for the accelerated schedule is tha t Satz, retiring in 2020 after 44 years as top prosecutor, wants to get a conviction of Cruz next year. Another reason, the defense says, is that Scherer is up for re-election, and a third is simply the massive media attention the massacre has received.&#10;&#10;Scherer sought Tuesday to keep the case on track for a Jan. 27 start by scheduling the December hearing on the motion for a continuance.&#10;&#10;“It's better to have it sooner rather than later,” the judge said.&#10;&#10;The defense motion notes that there are at least 1,000 witnesses identified by prosecutors in the case, and each of them must be interviewed by Cruz's lawyers. There are about 4 million pages of evidence, thousands of photos, videos, and social media posts and much more.&#10;&#10;There is still a huge amount of work to be done by the defense, Weekes said.&#10;&#10;“This court is pushing it forward at breakneck speed to acquiesce to the state,” he said.",

Guzman, 61, now faces a possible sentence of life in prison.&#10;&#10;Guzman was convicted on all 10 criminal charges he was tried for. US prosecutors said he had amassed a $14bn fortune through bribery, murder and drug smuggling.&#10;&#10;Guzman, one of the major figures in Mexican drug wars that have roiled the country since 2006, was extradited to the United States for trial in 2017 after he was arrested in Mexico the year before.&#10;&#10;Though other high-ranking cartel figures had been extradited previously, Guzman was the first to go to trial instead of pleading guilty.&#10;&#10;Guzan's trial included nearly three months of testimony about a vast drug-smuggling conspiracy steeped in violence.&#10;&#10;Throughout the months-long trial, the jury has heard more than 200 hours of testimony about Guzman's rise to power as the head of the Sinaloa cartel.&#10;&#10;Prosecutors said he is responsible for smuggling at least 200 tonnes of cocaine into the US and a wave of killings in turf wars with other cartels.&#10;&#10;The 11-week trial, which featured testimony from more than 50 witnesses, offered the public an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the cartel, named after the state in northwest Mexico where Guzman was born in a poor mountain village.&#10;&#10;Prosecutors said he trafficked tonnes of cocaine, heroin, cannabis and methamphetamine into the US over more than two decades, consolidating his power in Mexico through murders and wars with rival cartels.&#10;&#10;The defence has argued that Chapo was set up as a \"fall guy\" by Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, a drug kingpin from Sinaloa who remains at large.&#10;&#10;Mexico has been mired for 12 years in a deadly military-led war against drug gangs. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was elected last year after promising a change, suggesting a negotiated peace and amnesty for non-violent drug dealers, traffickers and farmers.&#10;&#10;The most detailed evidence against Guzman came from more than a dozen former associates who struck deals to cooperate with US prosecutors.&#10;&#10;Through them, jurors heard how the Sinaloa Cartel gained power amid the shifting allegiances of the Mexican drug trade in the 1990s, eventually coming to control almost the entire Pacific coast of Mexico.&#10;&#10;They heard how Guzman made a name for himself in the 1980s as \"El Rapido\", the speedy one, by building cross-border tunnels that allowed him to move cocaine from Mexico into the US faster than anyone else.&#10;&#10;The witnesses, who included some of Guzman's top lieutenants, a communications engineer and a one-time mistress, described how he built a sophisticated organisation reminiscent of a multinational corporation.&#10;&#10;They described fleets of planes and boats, detailed accounting ledgers and an encrypted electronic communication system run through secret computer servers in Canada.&#10;&#10;A former bodyguard testified that he watched Guzman kill three rival drug cartel members, including one victim who he shot and then ordered to be buried even as he was still gasping for air.&#10;&#10;Estimates of how much money Guzman made from drugs vary.&#10;&#10;In 2009, Forbes Magazine put him on its list of the world's richest people, with an estimated one billion dollars. It later dropped him from the list, saying it was too difficult to quantify his assets.&#10;&#10;The US Justice Department said in 2017 it sought forfeiture of more than $14bn in drug proceeds and illicit profits from Guzman.&#10;&#10;The trial also featured extensive testimony about corruption in Mexico, most of it involving bribes to law enforcement, military and local government officials so the cartel could carry out its day-to-day drug shipping operations undisturbed.&#10;&#10;The most shocking allegation came from Guzman's former top aide Alex Cifuentes, who accused former Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto of taking a $100m bribe from Guzman. A spokesman for the ex-president has denied the claim.&#10;&#10;In one of the trial's final days, Guzman told the judge he would not testify in his own defence.&#10;&#10;The same day, he grinned broadly at audience member Alejandro Edda, the Mexican actor who plays Guzman in the Netflix drama \"Narcos\".&#10;&#10;Despite his ties to government officials, Guzman often lived on the run.&#10;&#10;Imprisoned in Mexico in 1993, he escaped in 2001 hidden in a laundry cart and spent the following years moving from one hideout to another in the mountains of Sinaloa, guarded by a private army.&#10;&#10;He was seized and imprisoned again in 2014, but pulled off his best-known escape the following year when he disappeared into a tunnel dug into his cell in a maximum security prison.&#10;&#10;But the Mexican government says he blew his cover through a series of slip-ups, including an attempt to make a movie about his life.&#10;&#10;He was finally recaptured in January 2016 following a shoot-out in Sinaloa.",

         "Portugal police officers sentenced in unprecedented trial",
         "Lisbon, Portugal - Eight police officers were on Monday convicted of crimes ranging from aggravated kidnapping to grievous bodily harm against eight young black people in Lisbon.&#10;&#10;It was the end - for now at least - of an unprecedented court case which saw seventeen agents on trial, bringing the issue of institutional racism and police violence in Portugal into the public eye. The sentences handed out, however, met disappointment, with both sides intending to appeal.&#10;&#10;The case was brought against PSP (Portuguese, public-facing) police officers by the Public Ministry, and concerned the events of February 5, 2015, when police carried out an operation in Cova da Moura, a Lisbon neighbourhood known for its proud, predominantly Cape Verdean community. Two women, Neuza Correia and Jailsa Sousa - both bystanders - were left wounded after being shot with rubber-coated ammunition.&#10;&#10;A series of police detentions during the operation were on Monday found to have been illegal, tantamount to aggravated kidnapping, and resulting in the grievous bodily harm of a further six people - Bruno Lopes, Rui Moniz, Celso Lopes, Flavio Almada, Paulo Veiga and Miguel Reis.&#10;&#10;During the trial, it also emerged that police officers had falsified documentation and testimony in attempt to justify the detentions, alleging that the victims had been trying to \"storm\" the police station. While illegally detained, victims incurred injuries from broken bones to missing teeth. One was denied medication for a heart condition, the court heard.&#10;&#10;In April, the Public Ministry dropped the accusation of \"racial hatred\", as well as an accusation of torture, in what was seen as a blow to the victims' case, which contained reports of repeated racial slurs and insults. All of the police officers in the case are white, and all of the defendants are black; however, racism is not a prosecutable criminal offence in Portugal.&#10;&#10;\"The kind of discrimination they face every day because they're poor and from working-class communities, because they're black, because they work on the informal market, and so on - all of the prejudice they face in the streets, they also experienced, unfortunately, within the courtroom,\" Lucia Gomes, the victims' lawyer, told Al Jazeera.&#10;&#10;Monday's court session - the 34th since the trial got under way - began tensely, with at least 30 of the tiny courtroom's seats occupied quickly by off-duty police officers and police union reps, almost all of them men, who had been filling the corridors before the session began. That left only three seats for the victims. Their family and supporters - including the NGO SOS Racism - were forced to wait outside. When Judge Ester Pacheco entered the courtroom to read her final decision, there were only four black faces in the courtroom, including two of the victims - Flavio Almada and Celso Lopes - and their lawyer, Jose Semedo Fernandes.&#10;&#10;Judge Pacheco ruled that only one police officer would serve a prison sentence - of one year and six months - because he was already under a suspended sentence. The remaining seven convicted officers were given suspended prison sentences of between two months and five years, with the police station chief Luís Anunciacao receiving the longest sentence. The judge rejected the police officers' version of events almost in its entirety, referring in detail to the Police Code and to the Portuguese constitution to make her points about professionalism and human rights.&#10;&#10;However, it was the awarding of substantial compensation to the victims - which some officers will have to pay - that caused the most upset in the courtroom. Six of the victims were awarded payouts of around 10,000 euros ($11,160). Anunciacao received the largest bill, having been ordered to pay 50,000 euros ($55,780) to the victims.&#10;&#10;There were emotional scenes outside the courtroom as some victims and supporters cautiously celebrated a small but significant victory. Lawyer Lucia Gomes was clearly relieved yet reserved in her reaction: \"I can't say that I'm happy,\" she told Al Jazeera. \"The court had every possibility to go much further than it did.\"&#10;&#10;On social media, prominent members of Portuguese anti-racism movements denounced the sentences as \"shameful\" and \"pitiful\".&#10;&#10;\"The fact that organised Black movements have emerged onto the public sphere in recent years may explain the small victory of today,\" Pedro Schacht Pereira, an associate professor of Portuguese at the Ohio State University, told Al Jazeera. \"It is a ruling that gives an air of decency to the justice system, while preserving intact the idea that racism is not a Portuguese problem, since those charges were dropped.\"&#10;&#10;\"It's bittersweet,\" said SOS Racism director Mamadou Ba after the session, calling the sentences \"disproportionate\" to the crimes committed. \"Furthermore, the u-turn that the Public Ministry performed [on the charges of racism and torture] pose a serious challenge in the fight against institutional racism.\"&#10;&#10;The seventeen police officers were greeted with applause as they left the court building in Sintra - but many of them looked shaken. At least two have already made denouncements of slander against some of the victims. Peixoto Rodrigues, a police union leader, said they intended to appeal: \"First, we're going to analyse the decision that's been made.\"&#10;&#10;The sentencing comes a year since the trial began - and more than four years after the events it dealt with. \"I think they got off lightly,\" Flavio Almada told reporters outside the courthouse. \"Our families, our friends, and our community have suffered greatly.\"",

         "Two priests and a gardener have appeared in court to face charges of sexually abusing deaf children in their care, in a case that has sent shockwaves through Argentina's Catholic church.&#10;&#10;Priests Nicola Corradi, an 83-year-old Italian, and 59-year-old Argentine Horacio Corbacho, as well as former gardener Armando Gomez, 63, are accused of sexual abuse, corruption of children and mistreatment at a Catholic school for deaf children.&#10;&#10;They face prison sentences of up to 20 years in some cases, up to 50 years in others.&#10;&#10;The case relates to the abuse of around 20 children from the Provolo Institute in the western town of Mendoza. Corradi headed the institute, founded in 1995, until his arrest in November 2016.&#10;&#10;As the three accused - Corbacho and Gomez in handcuffs - were led down a long corridor in Mendoza's Palace of Justice on Monday to a court where three judges awaited them, alleged victims and their relatives protested outside, with one sign saying \"With Our Hands And Our Voices We Break The Silence,\" a reference to sign language.&#10;&#10;\"I am super-nervous, anxious and I hope for justice; that this ends soon so my son can move on to a new stage because this is very hard,\" said Natalia Villalonga, whose 18-year-old son Ezequiel was one of the students abused at the Provolo Institute.&#10;&#10;The alleged abuse took place between 2004 and 2016, and the case gained world attention when it emerged that Corradi had faced similar accusations at the Antonio Provolo Institute in Verona, Italy, and Pope Francis had been notified the Italian priest was running a similar centre in Argentina.&#10;&#10;Corbacho has pleaded not guilty to the sexual abuse charges, while Corradi and Gomez have not entered pleas.&#10;&#10;The closed-doors trial, expected to last two months, will hear testimony from 13 victims who suffered abuse between the ages of four and 17.&#10;&#10;It is the first in a series of trials involving other former members of the now-closed school.&#10;&#10;Others implicated include two nuns who allegedly participated or knew about the abuses, as well as former directors and employees who are accused of knowing about the abuse but taking no action.&#10;&#10;Jorge Bordon, an institute employee, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2018 in a case of rape, sexual touching and corrupting minors.&#10;&#10;Corradi moved to Argentina in 1970 from the original Provolo Institute in Verona - which has also been shaken by a paedophilia scandal in recent years - to run the Provolo in La Plata, before transferring to the Mendoza institute in 1998.&#10;&#10;His name appeared in a letter addressed to the pope in 2014 in which the Italian accusers mentioned several allegedly abusive priests who continued to exercise the ministry and said that Corradi and three other priests were in Argentina.&#10;&#10;The Verona diocese sanctioned four of the 24 defendants, but not Corradi.&#10;&#10;There was no criminal case because of the elapsed time.",

In the final hour, we’ll take a spin around Basil’s Magic Roundabout, with the Sunday Wire’s roving correspondent for Culture & Sport, Basil Valentine, to see who’s on and who’s off this week: Tony Blair’s attempt Labour Party coup could be a flop spawned from the contrived crisis of “Antisemitism in the Labour Party”, and across the pond the Democratic 2020 field is withering already and looks to degrade even further as Bernie Sanders jumped on the NeoCon regome change bandwagon with Venezuela. Also, Israel’s troubled Bibi Netanyahu goes hard-right forming a ‘Jewish Fascism‘ coalition in Israel. You literally couldn’t make it up . All this and so much more.

         "France Elodie Kulik murder trial after 17-year fight for justice",
         "Elodie Kulik was heading home from a restaurant in January 2002 when she was abducted, raped and then murdered.&#10;&#10;A 24-year-old bank manager working in the northern French town of Péronne, her car was targeted in an ambush and as she tried to call emergency services she was dragged from her vehicle.&#10;&#10;Despite a huge inquiry, no arrests were made and the trail then went cold.&#10;&#10;Now, after a relentless campaign by her father and ingenious use of DNA, a man has gone on trial 17 years later.&#10;&#10;Willy Bardon, 45, denies kidnapping, rape and murder and sat beside his lawyer as the trial got under way at a court in Amiens.&#10;&#10;Elodie's father, Jacky Kulik, arrived early for Thursday's trial. He lost his first two children in a car accident when they were five and six years old. His wife died in 2011 after trying to take her life and ending up in a coma.&#10;&#10;Cameras were allowed in the court as the judges arrived.&#10;&#10;Why it took so long&#10;&#10;The Elodie Kulik murder case went cold for a decade, until advances in DNA helped identify one of her attackers.&#10;&#10;The victim's body was found by a farmer on 12 January 2002 on a disused airbase. What was found at the crime scene gave investigators evidence they were able to use 10 years later - even though it was unusable at the time.&#10;&#10;Elodie had been partly burned by her killers. Traces of semen were found in a condom along with four sets of incomplete DNA and a fingerprint.&#10;&#10;While police interviewed 10,000 people and analysed 14,000 phone records, the DNA samples they had gathered failed to come up with a match on the national crime database. There was no broader DNA database at the time and the samples did not match anyone tested as part of the inquiry.&#10;&#10;In January 2011, a gendarmerie captain, Emmanuel Pham-Hoai, came up with the idea of using a technique tried out in Wales and in the US but never before in France.&#10;&#10;Instead of looking for a direct DNA match he searched for similar matches that might indicate a relative within the system - known as familial DNA searching.&#10;• How familial DNA trapped a murderer for the first time&#10;&#10;Within days, the DNA from the condom matched a man already in prison. Detectives told Le Monde newspaper how they then approached his wife and were able to confirm that the sample matched their children.&#10;&#10;They narrowed down their search to Grégory Wiart, a heating engineer who had died in a car accident in 2003. His body was exhumed and police then said they were sure he was one of the killers.&#10;&#10;Shortly afterwards police detained seven members of the same family, including Willy Bardon, the man on trial. He originally came from the same village as Wiart.&#10;&#10;Mr Bardon was charged after his voice was linked to the phone call made by Elodie Kulik to the emergency services. Male voices had been audible in the background and police say when they played the tape to Wiart's relatives, five of them recognised his voice.&#10;&#10;The defendant denies the voice was his. One of his lawyers, Stéphane Daquo, told AFP news agency this was \"the only trial where everyone who has their DNA at the scene of the crime is a witness and the only one who doesn't is accused\".&#10;&#10;More on DNA and rape:",

         "A new art exhibit explores Thomas Jefferson's highly influential architectural ideas and his vision for structures that symbolize liberty and democracy.&#10;&#10;But the exhibit also strives to spotlight some of the enslaved workers who helped construct many of the buildings that Jefferson designed.&#10;&#10;The exhibit opens Saturday at the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk, Virginia. The show offers another reckoning over the founding father's legacy and the role of enslaved Americans in U.S. history.&#10;&#10;Exhibit curator Erik Neil says Jefferson envisioned buildings for a new republic, not old-world kings. The domes and columns in his designs purposefully recalled ancient Greece and Rome.&#10;&#10;But he said it's impossible to talk about Jefferson without talking about the issue of slavery and race in America.",

         "TV comedy greats take a bow, make ’em laugh at ceremony",
         "“There’s nothing I believe more than this, that laughter adds time to one’s life,” Norman Lear told an audience gathered to honor him and other four other television comedy greats.&#10;&#10;“I believe that as much as I believe my mother loved me,” the writer-producer added. “She said she did. But I wasn’t sure.”&#10;&#10;Like the 97-year-old Lear, who made his name — and TV history — with groundbreaking sitcoms like “All in the Family” and “The Jeffersons,” the other honorees at Thursday’s Paley Center for Media ceremony proved that talent is ageless. Carl Reiner, 97; Bob Newhart, 90; Carol Burnett, 86, and Lily Tomlin, 80, each won over the room with their humor and memories.&#10;&#10;“Guess this is a hell of a time to tell you no, we’re not coming to your Christmas party,” Newhart teased Conan O’Brien after the late-night host introduced him as “one of my all-time comedy heroes.”&#10;&#10;“He pulls off the hardest kind of comedy — timeless, human, clean and subversive. And he makes it all look effortless,” O’Brien said of Newhart.&#10;&#10;The onetime accountant became an instant sensation in 1960 with his debut album, the Grammy-winning “The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart,” scored sitcom hits with “The Bob Newhart Show” in the 1970s and “Newhart” in the ’80s and won an Emmy as Professor Proton on “The Big Bang Theory.”&#10;&#10;The sentimental moments included Rob Reiner’s introduction of his father, the writer-actor-producer whose TV career stretched from the 1950s variety series “Caesar’s Hour” to creating “The Dick Van Dyke Show” to a recent role in “Angie Tribeca.”&#10;&#10;“This is the nicest thing, to be able to do this for my dad,” said the younger Reiner, who gave him an arm for support as they walked onto the hotel ballroom stage at The Paley Honors: A Special Tribute to Television’s Comedy Legends.&#10;&#10;Carl Reiner, who credited a government-supported acting program with his childhood start in entertainment, charmed the audience by reciting lines from a Shakespeare soliloquy he learned as a kid and sharing an anecdote about another TV comedy force, Jack Benny. He called his children and grandchildren his greatest pride.&#10;&#10;Carol Burnett was introduced by Kristin Chenoweth, who lauded the singer-actress-comedian as one of the few who can do it all and always “with such heart.”&#10;&#10;Burnett, who starred on Broadway, as well as TV, recalled what preceded the 1967 arrival of “The Carol Burnett Show.”&#10;&#10;“As a woman in this business, it wasn’t always easy to do what the naysayers said couldn’t be done,” she said. When she sought to exercise a contract clause with CBS for an hour-long variety show, Burnett said executives told her, “and I quote, ‘It’s not for you gals.’”&#10;&#10;She punctuated the story with a derisive “huh.” Her long-running show won armloads of Emmy Awards on CBS.&#10;&#10;Tomlin, whose parade of characters made her a hit on “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In” and who stars opposite Jane Fonda on “Grace and Frankie,” was self-effacing, saying she couldn’t match Newhart’s “sterling one-liners.” Instead, she delighted the audience by reciting some of her characters’ catchphrases, including telephone operator Ernestine’s “one ringy dingy.”&#10;&#10;“I’m so grateful for this great, great honor,” Tomlin said.&#10;&#10;Lear was introduced by “black-ish” star Anthony Anderson, who said Lear’s work forced audiences to confront difficult issues while shedding light on common bonds, and by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, who said the producer used laughter to challenge “us to make progress.”&#10;&#10;The night’s last word went to Lear.&#10;&#10;“Bless you all, thank you all. To be continued,” he said, smiling.&#10;&#10;Lynn Elber can be reached at lelber@ap.org and on Twitter at http://twitter.com/lynnelber&#10;&#10;This story has been corrected to quote Norman Lear as saying “Bless you, thank you all. To be continued,” not “Bless you all, thank you. Let me continue.”",

         "Musicians Team Up With Fans And Fight For The Future To Ban Facial Recognition Technology At Concerts",
         "Several musicians and festivals are coming together to call to an end to concert promoters using facial recognition at venues and music festivals, Vice News reported.&#10;&#10;Last year Live Nation announced it would begin deploying facial recognition at its concerts. The event organizer stated they would start having customers walk past facial recognition cameras instead of presenting their tickets, a horrifying first step for indoctrinating the public towards using the technology.&#10;&#10;This has spurred Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine, Glitch Mob’s Speedy Ortiz, and a growing number of dozens of other artists and festivals to team up with digital rights activist group, Fight For the Future, in a campaign.&#10;&#10;The campaign aims to call out Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, as well as other venues for using facial recognition on concert goers.&#10;&#10;The group of artists cite “dangers to their fans in the form of police harassment including — misidentification, deportation, arrests for outstanding charges during an event and drug use during an event, discrimination at their concerts, and fans in a permanent government database,” all very valid concerns.&#10;&#10;The other major concern by this writer that was left off the web page, is the technology would effectively turn every single person into a product, by venues and partner brands knowing what type of music each person likes. This could be abused in a variety of different ways including targeted advertising of groups of fans who like a certain genre of music, as well as email spam of up and coming concerts that a “fan” might like to see and hear.&#10;&#10;Lately, BIG brother has been pushing the use of surveillance technology, from Amazon helping law enforcement with its Facial Rekogntion software, DHS wanting to use it for border control, to the Olympics wanting to use the tech for security.&#10;&#10;Even retail is pushing for the technology as an anti-theft mechanism to be introduced in a thousands of stores using biometric facial recognition software FaceFirst to build a database of shoplifters, as Activist Post reported.&#10;&#10;Some of the biggest airports in the country — estimated at 16 airports across the U.S. — are now scanning us as we board international flights. While CBP (Customs And Border Patrol) expects to scale up the program to cover more than 97 percent of passengers flying outside of the U.S. by 2021 according to NextGov.&#10;&#10;Its all a part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s “Biometric exit” agenda, which was originally signed into law under the Obama administration, BuzzFeed News reported.&#10;&#10;Further, the policy director of U.S. CBP believes that facial recognition has already become essential. The agency’s head Deputy Executive Assistant Commissioner John Wagner has also hilariously said that its facial tracking technology isn’t surveillance, as Activist Post reported.&#10;&#10;In 2017, Homeland Security clarified their position on domestic spying stating Americans who don’t want faces scanned leaving the country “shouldn’t travel.”&#10;&#10;“The only way for an individual to ensure he or she is not subject to collection of biometric information when traveling internationally is to refrain from traveling,” the DHS wrote in a document.&#10;&#10;The NYPD adopted facial recognition technology eight years ago and dozens of other police departments have followed suit.&#10;&#10;The campaign website against using the technology at concerts reads:&#10;&#10;What can you do to stop this? According to the website, make some noise using social media, tweet at artists and click here for emails to top festivals/venues voicing your concerns demanding they don’t support the use of facial recognition.&#10;&#10;Here’s the default tweet, feel free to customize it a bit and make it unique while standing up for your rights with the hashtag: #BanFacialRecognition.&#10;&#10;Many likely laughed about the paranoid nature this writer has expressed when it comes to facial recognition technology; however, vindication came swiftly recently when Amazon announced it wanted to create a “Crime News Network” to monitor neighborhoods with its Ring doorbell facial recognition cameras. At this point, they are literally just creating George Orwell’s 1984 or reinventing the Stasi.&#10;&#10;The fight against facial recognition is just beginning, and this writer has been one of many attempting to champion that effort for years now. Don’t believe that we have already lost the battle, just because more and more facial recognition companies have been popping up. Doesn’t mean that we can’t stop the attempted nightmarish era of mass surveillance by the state and private companies.&#10;&#10;Already, we have had several wins in this long fight and there are signs of hope. First, San Francisco banned facial recognition technology being used by the government in May of this year, then Somerville, Massachusetts, and Oakland, California followed suit.&#10;&#10;The rapid growth of this technology has triggered a much-needed debate to slow down the roll out. Activists, politicians, academics and even police forces are expressing serious concerns over the impact facial recognition could have on our society.&#10;&#10;Several lawmakers have even chimed in to voice concerns about Amazon’s facial recognition software, expressing worry that it could be misused, The Hill reported.&#10;&#10;A Senate bill introduced in March would force companies who want to use facial recognition technology on consumers to first get their consent. If that happens as soon as the ink is dry Amazon’s Ring and Amazon’s Facial Rekognition which heavily relies on facial recognition technology could be banned across the U.S.&#10;&#10;Congress under the House Oversight Committee recently held a bipartisan discussion on the issue of regulating the use of facial recognition technology and biometric cameras.&#10;&#10;House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said, “there are virtually no controls …. Whatever walk of life you come from, you may be a part of this [surveillance] process.”&#10;&#10;The committee’s top Republican Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio.) also expressed “It’s time for a time out” on government use of the surveillance technology.&#10;&#10;Privacy advocate groups, attorneys, and even more recently Microsoft, which also markets its own facial recognition system, have all raised concerns over the technology, pointing to issues of consent, racial profiling, and the potential to use images gathered through facial recognition cameras as evidence of criminal guilt by law enforcement.",

         "Iran artist puts spotlight on water shortage through music",
         "Images of glowing light danced to a slow electronic beat, as an indistinguishable instrument radiated sound resembling flowing water.&#10;&#10;No more than 100 people sat down in the darkened cavern in the northwest Iranian city of Qazvin, while listening to the tune played by the electronic musician, Saba Alizadeh, who came up with the idea to highlight the ongoing water shortage in Iran.&#10;&#10;A century ago, it would have been impossible for the artist to entertain his audience there. The facility, common across pre-modern Iran, was originally built to store drinking water underground for local residents in Qazvin, 140km northwest of the capital Tehran.&#10;&#10;But for years now, most of these reservoirs have dried up, turning the structures into relics of Iran's past.&#10;&#10;The brick-lined water reservoir, known as Ab-Anbar in Persian, is covered with a dome, protecting the stored water from evaporation and contamination. It is connected to a wind tower, known as badgir, which serves as a natural cooler of the water inside.&#10;&#10;These reservoirs were so important to life, particularly in the desert areas, that they became integrated into communities in arid regions of the country.&#10;&#10;Alizadeh, the musician, saw an opportunity to revisit these architectural icons, in an effort to raise awareness about the country's water crisis.&#10;&#10;\"Metaphorically speaking, the concerts were a recollection of the water that did not exist there in the reservoirs any more,\" Alizadeh told Al Jazeera.&#10;&#10;\"It is supposed to sound the alarm, reminding Iranians that in a place which used to be a depot for water, now there is only dirt.\"&#10;&#10;Recently, the research arm of the Iranian parliament warned that water shortage in the country could lead to social discontent. It added that by 2020, up to 80 percent of Iran's more than 80 million people could face water scarcity.&#10;&#10;So far, Alizadeh has performed his show, Elegy for Water, at reservoirs in the cities of Qazvin, Kerman and Shiraz. The 35-year-old musician plans to do more events in Kashan, Yazd and Isfahan, cities that in recent years have faced water shortages.&#10;&#10;The water problem in these major cities has been exacerbated by poor infrastructures and government policies.&#10;&#10;About 35 million Iranians, a little less than half of the total population, living across 334 cities faced water shortage during the summer of 2018, according to Iran's Minister of Energy Reza Ardakanian.&#10;&#10;Lack of awareness about the issue has further added to the problem.&#10;&#10;\"We are facing a severe drought ... We don't seem to pay attention to the things that are happening in this regard,\" Alizadeh said.&#10;&#10;\"Perhaps this tour could be a very small gesture to remind people of water; so that they could appreciate it a bit more,\" he said, referring to the wastage of water in the country.&#10;&#10;Alizadeh came up with the idea of the musical piece in 2012, when he started to study music at the California Institute for Arts, after he finished his bachelor's degree in photography in Iran. It was only much later, when he decided to perform the piece at dried-up cisterns to highlight the growing water problem.&#10;&#10;The musician uses Zanjeer - which is made of small chains hanging off a wooden handle - as a source for musical notes.&#10;&#10;Zanjeer is mostly used during annual Ashura commemorations by Shia Muslims, who hit their bodies with the object to mourn the death of their third Imam.&#10;&#10;Alizadeh installed a microphone at the end of Zanjeer's handle to capture the granular sound made by the movement of the chains.&#10;&#10;The rattling of the chains is then processed by a computer to become a sound that is reminiscent of that of flowing water.&#10;&#10;\"I wrote the harmonies within the sound of the water,\" he explained.&#10;&#10;The initial piece was completed with an overture that he wrote recently, turning Elegy for Water into a 40-45 minute-long musical number.&#10;&#10;The performance includes visuals created by artist Siavash Naghshbandi, who collaborated on the project. The images were an artistic perception of the reflections of water. They were projected on the walls of the water cisterns.&#10;&#10;Speaking to Al Jazeera, Naghshbandi referred to the \"mysterious\" quality of the forms that the flow of the water creates; as well as the irony of watching those visuals in a dried-up cistern.&#10;&#10;\"The images were projected on the ceiling. It was as if you saw the reflections of the water when you take a look above, knowing there is no water in the reservoir,\" he said.&#10;&#10;Roshanka Sajadian, a Tehran-based architect, took a two-hour road trip to Qazvin to watch the show.&#10;&#10;\"The combination of the concept, the music and the location turned this into a curious event,\" she told Al Jazeera.&#10;&#10;\"It was as if I was nailed to my chair, wiping tears off my face as the music rose to a crescendo.\"&#10;&#10;Andreas Spechtl, an Austrian musician who collaborated with Alizadeh on the project, told Al Jazeera that the artist is \"mourning the loss of water, while treating a highly traditional and religious device, Zanjeer, as an electronic instrument.\"&#10;&#10;\"One could call it conceptual art. But it's not that easy, because there are no answers and no great solutions in his work. He is not making a big case. No. He's now and then dropping a question. And that's the noblest thing you can say about art.\"",

         "St. Louis, KC seek tougher gun laws amid violence uptick",
         "A bill requiring St. Louis gun dealers to alert police when a firearms purchase is denied because of a criminal background check is the latest step in addressing violence in a city beset by gun crimes.&#10;&#10;St. Louis aldermen unanimously gave final approval to the bill Friday. Supporters say 30% of criminals who try to purchase guns but fail to do so because of background checks are arrested within five years. The bill awaits Democratic Mayor Lyda Krewson's signature.&#10;&#10;Missouri's big cities, St. Louis and Kansas City, have among the highest homicide rates in the nation. Both are seeking to address the problem through tougher local gun laws since statewide legislation is unlikely in the conservative-led state, where Republican Gov. Mike Parson has pledged \"to protect the rights of the Second Amendment for law-abiding citizens.\"&#10;&#10;A message left with Parson's office was not immediately returned Friday.&#10;&#10;In St. Louis, where Parson assigned highway patrol officers to help fight crime in September, the situation is made more tragic by the fact that 13 of those killed in shootings this year were children, all of them black.&#10;&#10;St. Louis aldermanic President Lewis Reed said the city law will help alert police to people with criminal records who are seeking guns.&#10;&#10;\"This is one more piece to the puzzle, and it's an important piece,\" Reed said. \"We're no longer going to wait for the state to do the right thing, or the federal government to do the right thing.\"&#10;&#10;It wasn't immediately clear if the attorney general's office in Missouri would challenge the law on grounds that it conflicts with state law. A spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schmitt declined comment, saying the office had not seen details.&#10;&#10;Another St. Louis measure under consideration would designate the city's parks as child care facilities so they're exempt from a Missouri law allowing people to carry concealed firearms without permits and training. Signs explaining the gun prohibition would be posted at park entrances, parking areas, playgrounds and sports fields. Several St. Louis killings have happened at parks or near them.&#10;&#10;Child cares, churches, hospitals and some other places can ban the carrying of guns under state law. But parks are not on the list.&#10;&#10;In Kansas City, the City Council approved two laws aimed at keeping guns away from children. One of the laws, passed in August, makes it a local offense for minors to have handguns. The other prohibits adults from recklessly giving minors guns without their parents' permission.&#10;&#10;Last week, Democratic Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas proposed an ordinance that would allow police to take firearms from domestic violence offenders or those who are the subject of restraining orders. A similar federal law exists but backers say a local law would help police and prosecutors pursue the cases.&#10;&#10;St. Louis has had 165 homicides in 2019 and is on pace to top last year's total of 186. In Kansas City, 122 homicides have occurred this year, and the city is on pace to top last year's 138 killings.",

         "Prosecutors charge man with hate crime in acid attack",
         "A 61-year-old white Milwaukee man accused of throwing acid on a Hispanic man's face will be charged with a hate crime, increasing the possible sentence he may receive if convicted, prosecutors announced Wednesday.&#10;&#10;Prosecutors filed one charge against Clifton Blackwell — first-degree reckless injury — but added the sentencing enhancers of hate crime and use of a dangerous weapon. The two enhancers could add 10 years in prison if he's convicted of first-degree reckless injury, which is punishable by up to 25 years.&#10;&#10;The victim, Mahud Villalaz, 42, said his attacker approached him near a restaurant Friday night and confronted him about being parked too close to a bus stop, according to charging documents. Prosecutors said Blackwell then asked, \"Why did you invade my country?\" and \"Why don't you respect my laws?\"&#10;&#10;Villalaz said he moved his car but that Blackwell continued to berate him, calling him \"illegal\" and telling him to \"go back, go back,\" followed by an expletive. Villalaz said he called Blackwell a racist, also using an expletive. Villalaz said Blackwell threw the acid on him after Villalaz said \"everyone come from somewhere first\" and that American Indians had been in the country the longest.&#10;&#10;Surveillance video from the restaurant recorded the attack, which left Villalaz with second-degree burns on his face.&#10;&#10;Villalaz is a U.S. citizen who immigrated from Peru.&#10;&#10;Blackwell made his first court appearance Wednesday to be advised of the charges he faces. Bond was set at $20,000 but it's on the condition he wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. He's still being held at the Milwaukee County jail and his public defender did not immediately return a call.&#10;&#10;The attack on Villalaz comes at a time when the Anti-Defamation League says extreme anti-immigrant views have become part of the political mainstream in recent years through sharp rhetoric by anti-immigration groups and politicians, including President Donald Trump.&#10;&#10;White House spokesman Judd Deere said Monday that the Trump administration has repeatedly condemned racism and violence.&#10;&#10;Investigators who searched Blackwell's home found among other things four bottles of sulfuric acid, muriatic acid, and two bottles of Kleen-Out drain opener that was 100 % lye, according to the search warrant. Additional conditions for his bond are that he have no contact with acids or large batteries, or possess dangerous weapons or firearms. His next court appearance is Nov. 15.&#10;&#10;Before filing the charge, Milwaukee District Attorney John Chisholm said during an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio that his office was looking to determine whether the attack was motivated \"in whole or in part\" based on the victim's race. He said prosecutors would look \"very closely first at the underlying offenses and then we'll make a determination whether the facts support the hate crime.\"&#10;&#10;\"But it's obviously a concern to many people not just in this community but really around the country right now,\" he said.&#10;&#10;Just as Blackwell was in court, Villalaz spoke briefly to reporters to say he was pleased with the charges and thankful for \"the people that have worried about me.\" He said Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin called him to say she was \"very sad\" about what happened and offered to help however she can.&#10;&#10;His mother, Jacqueline P. Blackwell, of California, told the Journal Sentinel he had sought care with the Department of Veterans Affairs in Milwaukee for post-traumatic stress.&#10;&#10;\"I was comfortable that he was getting good care with the VA,\" she told the newspaper.&#10;&#10;His brother, Arthur Eugene Blackwell of Evergreen, Colorado, told the AP that Clifton served nearly four years in the U.S. Marines and was stationed at the Panama Canal around the time Manuel Noriega was captured and removed in 1990. A Marine official told AP that the branch doesn't have a record matching Blackwell's name and birthdate.&#10;&#10;State court records show Blackwell was convicted in a 2006 Rusk County case of false imprisonment and pointing a gun at a person in a case where he held four hunters at gunpoint because they were on his property.",

Tomlin is already jailed and charged with three counts of felony child neglect prior to reporting Noah missing.",

         "2 escaped murder suspects arrested at US-Mexico border",
         "Authorities are trying to determine if anyone helped two inmates who escaped from a California jail, traveled hundreds of miles and crossed into Mexico before being captured trying to walk back into the United States.\n\nJonathan Salazar, 20, and Santos Fonseca, 21, were arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials at a port of entry in San Ysidro — the nation's largest border crossing — early Wednesday, Monterey County Sheriff's Office Capt. John Thornburg said.\n\nThornburg said the two are in the custody of Monterey County officials and have been returned to a jail in Salinas, a farming city of about 160,000 people roughly 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of San Francisco.\n\nSalazar and Fonseca escaped Sunday from the lockup in Salinas after climbing through a hole they made in the ceiling of a bathroom, squeezing through a hollow wall and kicking open a hatch. Officials found their jail-issued jumpsuits outside the building. Inmates often wear their own clothes under the jumpsuits, Thornburg said.\n\nInvestigators have not yet determined how long they worked on making the hole or if anyone else helped them escape or helped them after they were out. They were reported missing at 8:15 a.m. Sunday.\n\nThornburg said authorities received a tip that the pair, both born and raised in Salinas, had been spotted in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, around 400 miles (644 kilometers) south of Monterey County, and alerted federal officials.\n\nCBP spokeswoman Jackie Wasiluk said the men didn't present any documents. They said they were U.S. citizens, and a check of law enforcement databases told border inspectors that they were wanted by authorities.\n\nHow the pair made it to Mexico, why they decided to travel together since they allegedly belong to rival gangs and why they returned to the United States is under investigation, Thornburg said.\n\n\"The good news here is they are in custody again,\" Thornburg said.\n\nSalazar and Fonseca will be housed separately in a different housing unit from the one they escaped, Thornburg said, adding that officials had already made security improvements to the jail. He said he couldn't provide details.\n\nBefore being spotted in Tijuana, investigators received a credible tip from an employee at a motel in Marina about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the jail who told authorities Salazar had checked in there Tuesday morning, but authorities found no one in the room after a nearly eight-hour standoff, Thornburg said.\n\n\"It all looked like we had Mr. Salazar in a motel,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, last night he wasn't there.\"\n\nBoth had been in custody since 2018 and were awaiting trial on murder counts and \"numerous other felony charges\" in separate cases.\n\nSalazar was arrested in the shooting death of 20-year-old Jaime Martinez as the victim drove in Salinas with his girlfriend and 18-month-old son. The woman was shot and treated at a hospital, while the child wasn't hurt.\n\nPolice investigated the Oct. 12, 2017, shooting as gang-related. Officers said his tattoos, including the letter P on his cheek, refer to his Sureño offshoot gang, La Posada Trece, the Californian reported. His trial was scheduled to begin in January.\n\nFonseca told police after his arrest on homicide charges that his gang leader told him to kill someone to prove he was still loyal to the Boronda Boys, a subset of the Norteño gang, Detective Gabriela Contreras testified.\n\nFonseca is charged with shooting Lorenzo Gomez Acosta, 37, to death on June 2, 2018, while the victim sat in his car on a video call with his wife in Mexico, the Californian reported.\n\nShe saw a scuffle, heard her husband screaming \"no\" and then gunshots rang out, Salinas police Officer Froylan Aranda said. Acosta was reportedly chosen at random.\n\nThree days later, Fonseca shot and killed Ernesto Garcia Cruz, 27, in a Salinas park, authorities said.

         "Physician, Father and Caretaker of 29 Year Old Autistic Man Found Brutally Murdered",
         "\"One family member said Derek “can be violent and has attacked Rex in the past,” court documents stated. The family member also said Derek’s mother had died years ago and Rex was taking care of him alone.\" \n\n\n\nThis grisly story offers another side to the shiny, happy portrayal of autism during the month of April. A Spokane, Washington widowed physician, age 61, was found brutally murdered and his 29 year old, preverbal autistic son living amid squalor. It appears that the son is at least, a suspect. If not, he is also a victim, left alone in the home without life skills.  Either version is a far cry from what we're spoon fed about autism. This kind of tragic story is going to repeat itself over and over, like the stories of autistic children wandering and drowning. Parents will age. Strong adult men (and women) with autism will rage. The future may be bleak and harsh. Meanwhile, we're told we are \"allowed\" to seek awareness, but not cure or even true treatment. Our loved ones must suffer a lifetime of... autism.  God bless Dr. Rex Porter and his son Derek. \n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\n\n\nDetectives are investigating the death of a retired Spokane anesthesiologist whose body was found dismembered and burned in the backyard of his Dishman Hills area home.\n\nThe victim, Dr. Rex C. Porter, 61, previously worked for Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center. He was the caretaker of his son, Derek C. Porter, 29, who is autistic and nonverbal, according to court documents. They lived on an 11-acre property in the 2800 block of South Park Lane near the Iller Creek Conservation Area.\n\nOn Saturday, a neighbor called 911 to report that Porter’s car had been sitting in the driveway for two days with a door open. A garage door had been left open, too.\n\nSpokane County Sheriff’s deputies responded Sunday to the house for a welfare check, according to a search warrant filed Tuesday in Spokane County Superior Court.\n\nDeputies reported seeing the house in disarray as they looked through the windows, including broken glass on the floor. Attempts to call Rex Porter were unsuccessful, prompting deputies to enter the house. They smelled a strong odor they believed to be animal feces, according to court documents.\n\nDeputies continued their search downstairs to the basement and found more glass, along with blood and damaged items. They opened a door and “suddenly an adult male was standing in front of them with only shorts and a T-shirt,” according to court documents.\n\nDeputies detained the individual, believing he was squatting in the house, according to court records.\n\nIn the bathroom, the toilet was full of feces and the sink held what deputies thought was the remains of a dead animal, court records stated....  Read more at Spokesman.com",

         "US: White officer charged with murder in shooting of black woman",
         "A white police officer who shot and killed an African American woman in her Fort Worth, Texas, home in the presence of her eight-year-old nephew was charged with murder on Monday after resigning from the force.\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department said its officers were responding to a call from a neighbour, who reported to a non-emergency line, that Atatiana Jefferson's front door had been left open. The responding officer fired a shot through a window, killing 28-year-old Jefferson.\n\nInterim Police Chief Ed Kraus said at a news conference on Monday that the officer, Aaron Dean, resigned. He said if Dean had not stepped down, he would have been fired, adding that the officer acted inappropriately.\n\nThe family had called for Dean's arrest.\n\nIn a statement released over the weekend, Fort Worth police said officers saw someone near a window inside the home and that one of them drew his duty weapon and fired after \"perceiving a threat\". The body camera video released by police shows two officers searching the home from the outside with flashlights before one shouts, \"Put your hands up, show me your hands.\" One shot is then fired through a window.\n\nIn the video, the officer does not identify himself as police.\n\n\"Nobody looked at this video and said that there's any doubt that this officer acted inappropriately,\" Kraus said.\n\n\"I feel like we had some failures here,\" Fort Worth Police Officers Association President Manny Ramirez told reporters after the news conference. \"It never should have happened.\"\n\nFort Worth Mayor Betsy Price called for \"justice and closure\" for Jefferson's family.\n\nEarlier on Monday, family members described Jefferson as a smart, nurturing woman who recently moved in with her mother to help care for her in her declining health. A sister, Ashley Carr, said Jefferson embodied, honour, integrity, commitment and service.\n\n\"Any neighbourhood would be proud to have her as a neighbour and any city would be proud to have her as a citizen,\" Carr said.\n\nA single bullet hole was visible in the window of the single-story, freshly painted purple home and floral tributes and stuffed animals piled up in the street outside Jefferson's home.\n\nAccording to a demographics report released by the Fort Worth Police Department, nearly two-thirds of its 1,100 officers were white, as of June 30. Just over 20 percent were Hispanic or Latino and about 10 percent were black.\n\nRelations with the public have been strained after other recent Fort Worth police shootings. In June, the department released body camera footage of officers fatally shooting a man who ignored repeated orders to drop his handgun. He was the fourth person Fort Worth police had fired upon in 10 days.\n\nEd Kraus took over as interim police chief in the city in May after the previous chief was fired.\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Officers Association issued a statement on Sunday calling for \"a thorough and transparent investigation\" into the shooting.\n\nFort Worth police said it released the bodycam footage soon after the shooting for transparency, but that any \"camera footage inside the residence\" could not be distributed due to state law.\n\nThe bodycam video included blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom. It is unclear if the firearm was found near Jefferson, and police have not said that the officer who shot her thought she was holding a gun. The police statement released Saturday said only that officers who entered the residence after the shooting found a firearm, and Lieutenant Brandon O'Neil would not answer reporters' questions Sunday on why police released images of the gun.\n\nO'Neil said the officer would meet with investigators from the Fort Worth Police Department on Monday about the shooting. Police previously said the officer, a white man, joined the department in April 2018.\n\nA large crowd gathered outside Jefferson's home Sunday night for a vigil after earlier demonstrations briefly stopped traffic on part of Interstate 35.\n\nJefferson was a 2014 graduate of Xavier University in New Orleans and earned a bachelor's degree in biology, the university said. Merritt told the Star-Telegram that Jefferson was working in pharmaceutical equipment sales and was considering going back to medical school.\n\nNearly 700 killed by police in 2019\n\nFort Worth is about 50km (30 miles) west of Dallas, where another high-profile police shooting occurred last year. In that case, white Dallas police officer Amber Guyger fatally shot her black neighbour Botham Jean inside his own apartment after Guyger said she mistook it for her own. Guyger, 31, was sentenced this month to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn Georgia, a former white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed, naked, black man was found not guilty of murder on Monday.\n\nJurors did convict Robert \"Chip\" Olsen of aggravated assault, violation of oath of office and making a false statement. Olsen's face turned red and he squeezed his eyes shut tightly when the verdict was red. His wife, Kathy Olsen, began sobbing and had to be led from the court.\n\nOlsen, now 57, was a DeKalb County police officer in March 2015 when he responded to a call of a naked man behaving erratically outside an Atlanta-area apartment complex. Shortly after arriving, he fatally shot 26-year-old Anthony Hill, an Air Force veteran who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post's Fatal Force database, at least 689 people have been killed by police in the US so far in 2019. At least 992 people were killed by the police in 2018 and more than 980 people were killed by police the previous year.\n\nAccording to watchdog group The Sentencing Project, African American men are six times more likely to be arrested than white men.\n\nThese disparities, particularly the killing of African Americans by police, has prompted the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, a popular civil rights campaign aimed at ending police violence and dismantling structural racism.",

He now faces a mandatory life sentence without parole.\n\nMr Dalton, who submitted his plea while jury selection was taking place, did so despite the objections of his attorney.\n\nHe told the judge at the Kalamazoo County court that he had made the decision of his own free will, adding that he had \"wanted this for quite a while\".\n\nMr Dalton had earlier reportedly told police that he was made a \"puppet\" by the Uber application, which directed him to shoot people at random over a five-hour period in February 2016.\n\nAlthough none of the victims were Uber customers, police said Mr Dalton continued to pick up passengers during the shooting spree in Kalamazoo, a small city about 150 miles (241km) west of Detroit.\n\nThe shootings took place on a Saturday evening at three locations - outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant, a Kia car dealership and an apartment block.\n\nFollowing his arrest that evening, Uber confirmed that Mr Dalton was a driver registered with the app-based cab-hailing company, issuing a statement saying that it was \"horrified and heartbroken\" at the violence.\n\nMr Dalton had undergone background checks but passed because he had no criminal record, Uber said.",

         "SAN FRANCISCO -- A judge has ruled that a 29-year-old parolee with a history of mental illness is mentally fit to stand trial for the slaying of a woman on an Oakland subway platform.\n\nAlameda County Superior Court Judge James Cramer said Tuesday that John Lee Cowell will face trial starting in January for the unprovoked stabbing death of 18-year-old Nia Wilson in July 2018, KPIX-TV reported.\n\nCowell has been charged with murder and attempted murder for the attack on Wilson and her sister, Letifah, 26, who was wounded in the attack.\n\nThe trial had been in legal limbo as authorities sought to determine Cowell's mental competence. At a hearing Monday, Cramer said that Cowell was not cooperating with doctors appointed last month to evaluate him, for the latest in a series of evaluations.

The judge recessed the hearing, saying he needed 24 hours to reach his decision and announced his ruling Tuesday.\n\nWilson's death was one of several violent or fatal attacks on Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) lines that connect San Francisco to the cities of Berkeley, Oakland and others.\n\nBART has announced new safety measures and installed thousands of security cameras as part of an effort to increase safety.\n\nProsecutors have said they will seek a life sentence against Cowell and are investigating if he was motivated by racial hate when he killed Wilson.

         "The trial of Loujain al-Hathloul, one of nearly a dozen prominent Saudi Arabian women's rights activists jailed since last year, will begin on Wednesday, her family has said.\n\nDozens of other activists, intellectuals and clerics have been arrested separately in the past two years in an apparent bid to stamp out opposition to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has consolidated power, including through a sweeping anti-corruption campaign.\n\n\"My sister @LoujainHathloul will be having her first trial session next Wednesday at 8am at the specialised court in Riyadh. This is the court [that] deals with terrorism cases,\" her brother Walid wrote on Sunday on Twitter.\n\nHe said she was not allowed to have a lawyer and had not been provided with a list of indictments.\n\nThe public prosecutor said last June that five men and four women had been arrested and held on suspicion of harming the country's interests and offering support to hostile elements abroad. Saudi media widely denounced them as traitors.\n\nIt was unclear if the other detainees will also stand trial this week.\n\nActivists claim some detainees, including 29-year-old Hathloul, were held in solitary confinement and subjected to mistreatment and torture, including electric shocks, flogging, and sexual assault. Saudi officials have denied those allegations as \"false\".\n\nThe arrests have intensified international criticism of Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul sparked global outrage.\n\nThree dozen countries, including all 28 European Union members, called on Riyadh last week to release the activists, the first rebuke of the kingdom at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) since it was set up in 2006.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his British counterpart have also said they raised the issue with the Saudi authorities during recent visits.\n\nThe Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the public prosecutor's office said earlier this month it had completed its investigations of the detainees and was preparing their trials.\n\nHathloul, who advocated an end to a ban on women driving and the kingdom's male guardianship system, was previously jailed for 73 days in 2014 after she attempted to drive into Saudi Arabia from the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe driving ban was lifted in June, weeks after she was rearrested.

         "A couple from the US state of California have been sentenced to life in prison for starving and torturing all but one of their 13 children.\n\nDavid and Louise Turpin were arrested in January 2018 when their 17-year-old daughter escaped their home in the city of Perris and raised the alarm.\n\nThe children had been abused for at least nine years and some were found chained up in filthy conditions.\n\nBut several of the children told the court they had forgiven their parents.\n\nThe couple are expected to serve the rest of their lives behind bars, unless they are granted parole in 25 years.\n\nThe Turpins wept as they heard victim-impact statements from four of their children at Friday's hearing.\n\nOne child recounted being haunted by the ordeal.\n\nI cannot describe in words what we went through growing up,\" said his statement.\n\n\"Sometimes I still have nightmares of things that had happened such as my siblings being chained up or getting beaten.\n\n\"That is the past and this is now.\n\n\"I love my parents and have forgiven them for a lot of the things they did to us.\"\n\nAnother child, in a statement read by her brother, also forgave her parents for the abuse.\n\n\"I love both of my parents so much,\" she said.\n\n\"Although it may not have been the best way of raising us, I am glad that they did because it made me the person I am today.\"\n\nBut not all the children were so conciliatory.\n\nOne daughter, who was visibly shaking, said: \"My parents took my whole life from me, but now I'm taking my life back.\n\n\"I'm a fighter, I'm strong and I'm shooting through life like a rocket.\"\n\nShe added: \"I saw my dad change my mom. They almost changed me, but I realised what was happening.\"\n\nDavid and Louise Turpin cried as they apologised for the treatment of their children.\n\nThe 57-year-old father's lawyer read a prepared statement on his behalf, saying: \"My home schooling and discipline had good intentions.\n\n\"I never intended for any harm to come to my children. I love my children and I believe my children love me.\"\n\nHe was an engineer for major US defence contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.\n\nSpeaking directly to the court, housewife Louise Turpin, 50, said she was \"truly sorry\" for what she had done.\n\n\"I love my children so much,\" she said. \"I really look forward to the day I can see them, hug them and tell them I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe couple sat stony-faced as the judge rebuked them for their \"selfish, cruel and inhuman treatment\".\n\nJudge Bernard Schwartz said: \"You have severed the ability to interact and raise your children that you have created and brought into this world.\n\n\"The only reason that your punishment is less than the maximum time in my opinion is because you accepted responsibility at an early stage in the proceeding.\n\n\"And you spared your children having to relive the humiliation and the harm they endured in that house of horrors.\"\n\nThe tidy exterior of the middle-class family home 70 miles (112km) south of Los Angeles offered a veneer of respectability that masked the squalor and stench of human waste found by authorities within.\n\nThe children, between the ages of two to 29 at the time of the police raid, were severely malnourished.\n\nA 22-year-old son was discovered chained to a bed. His two sisters had just been released from shackles.\n\nThe victims were forbidden to shower more than once a year, were unable to use the toilet and none of them had ever seen a dentist.\n\nSome of the adult siblings' growth had been so severely stunted by starvation that authorities at first mistook them for children.\n\nNewly released audio of their daughter's call to 911, obtained by ABC, provides a hint of the conditions in which the children lived.\n\n\"Two of my sisters and one of my brothers... they're chained up to their bed\", the 17-year-old girl, who did not know her own address, told the emergency operator.\n\n\"Sometimes I wake up and I can't breathe because how dirty the house is.\"\n\nThe girl was also unaware of the year or month, or the meaning of the word \"medication\".\n\nThe children - whose names all begin with the letter J - were kept indoors, but were allowed out for Halloween, or on family trips to Disneyland and Las Vegas.\n\nAbout 20 people from across the country, including nurses and psychologists, have offered to care for the seven adult siblings and six children.",

         "The  in Hollywood continues to eat itself, as the politically correct culture is now being used to protect the public images of despots and dictators – as long as the price is right.\n\nOne can only imagine what the threat, or promise of future cash was which prompted this latest censorship move by the vapid cultural gatekeepers at Netflix.\n\nNetflix has removed an episode of comedy show Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj for viewers in Saudi Arabia after the country complained about the host’s criticism of its war in Yemen and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the FT, the streaming site confirmed it had removed the episode, which is described on the website as: “Hasan exposes grim truths about Saudi Arabia and the charismatic crown prince known as ‘MBS [Mohammed bin Salman].'”\n\nThe decision followed a complaint made by Saudi Arabia’s Communications and Information Technology Commission on the grounds that the episode violated the anti-cyber crime law against “material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy”.\n\nUnder Article 6 of Saudi Arabia’s anti-cyber crime law, “production, preparation, transmission, or storage” of such material “through the information network or computers” is punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a 3m Saudi riyal ($800,000) fine.\n\nIn the episode, the comedian takes aim at the kingdom in the aftermath of Khashoggi’s assassination inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October.\n\nBoth the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which he calls “the biggest tragedy of the MBS era”, and the crown prince himself come in for criticism. Minhaj calls for American ties to the oil-rich kingdom to be placed under the spotlight.\n\n“Now would be a good time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia. And I mean that as a Muslim, and as an American,” he says in the episode.\n\nNetflix defended the decision in a statement, saying: “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request – and to comply with local law.”\n\nThe report has provoked a response from many prominent figures on social media.\n\n“Wow. When Netflix censors material on behalf of Mohammad bin Salman,” tweeted Iyad el-Baghdadi, a Norway-based human rights activist. “Many of us Arabs were very excited when Netflix launched its MENA division, because we thought this is a way in which we can bypass censorship. I guess there’s the end of that.”\n\n“Money always comes ahead of principles. Corporatism is a pillar of the structure of power that keeps us pinned down,” he added.\n\nOthers on social media shared Baghdadi’s concern, wondering how much influence Mohammed bin Salman had over Netflix.",

         "Judge to consider delaying trial start in Parkland massacre",
         "The judge overseeing the case of Florida school shooting defendant Nikolas Cruz said Tuesday she will consider a defense request to delay the start of trial beyond late January.\n\nBroward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer set a Dec. 19 date for arguments on the motion by defense lawyers who claim the case is moving much too swiftly and runs the risk of legal errors. That could mean a conviction of Cruz might be reversed on appeal, sending it back for another high-profile trial.\n\nProsecutors have been pushing hard to start the trial with jury selection beginning Jan. 27. Broward State Attorney Mike Satz, who is the chief prosecutor on the case, said the motion to delay trial must be heard quickly.\n\n“We just can't wait until the last minute,” Satz said at a hearing.\n\nCruz, 21, faces 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the Valentine's Day 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He faces the death penalty if convicted, although his lawyers say he will plead guilty in return for a life prison sentence.\n\nIn their motion, defense lawyers noted that of 38 capital punishment cases in Broward County since 1994, the average time they remained pending between arrest and trial was 52 months, or a little over four years.\n\nOn the current schedule, Cruz's trial would begin less than two years after the mass shooting on Feb. 14, 2018. He was arrested that same day. Defense lawyers say that is far too fast for them to adequately prepare a defense in a case of such magnitude.\n\n“We want to make sure it's done once and it's done right,” said Gordon Weekes, chief assistant public defender in Broward County. “Expedience has taken precedence over the prudent disposition of this case.”\n\nThe defense motion suggests that one reason for the accelerated schedule is tha t Satz, retiring in 2020 after 44 years as top prosecutor, wants to get a conviction of Cruz next year. Another reason, the defense says, is that Scherer is up for re-election, and a third is simply the massive media attention the massacre has received.\n\nScherer sought Tuesday to keep the case on track for a Jan. 27 start by scheduling the December hearing on the motion for a continuance.\n\n“It's better to have it sooner rather than later,” the judge said.\n\nThe defense motion notes that there are at least 1,000 witnesses identified by prosecutors in the case, and each of them must be interviewed by Cruz's lawyers. There are about 4 million pages of evidence, thousands of photos, videos, and social media posts and much more.\n\nThere is still a huge amount of work to be done by the defense, Weekes said.\n\n“This court is pushing it forward at breakneck speed to acquiesce to the state,” he said.",

         "Mexican drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman guilty in US trial",
         "Notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman was found guilty in a US court on Tuesday of operating a criminal enterprise.\n\nJurors in federal court in Brooklyn began delivering their verdict following an 11-week trial. Guzman, 61, now faces a possible sentence of life in prison.\n\nGuzman was convicted on all 10 criminal charges he was tried for. US prosecutors said he had amassed a $14bn fortune through bribery, murder and drug smuggling.\n\nGuzman, one of the major figures in Mexican drug wars that have roiled the country since 2006, was extradited to the United States for trial in 2017 after he was arrested in Mexico the year before.\n\nThough other high-ranking cartel figures had been extradited previously, Guzman was the first to go to trial instead of pleading guilty.\n\nGuzan's trial included nearly three months of testimony about a vast drug-smuggling conspiracy steeped in violence.\n\nThroughout the months-long trial, the jury has heard more than 200 hours of testimony about Guzman's rise to power as the head of the Sinaloa cartel.\n\nProsecutors said he is responsible for smuggling at least 200 tonnes of cocaine into the US and a wave of killings in turf wars with other cartels.\n\nThe 11-week trial, which featured testimony from more than 50 witnesses, offered the public an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the cartel, named after the state in northwest Mexico where Guzman was born in a poor mountain village.\n\nProsecutors said he trafficked tonnes of cocaine, heroin, cannabis and methamphetamine into the US over more than two decades, consolidating his power in Mexico through murders and wars with rival cartels.\n\nThe defence has argued that Chapo was set up as a \"fall guy\" by Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, a drug kingpin from Sinaloa who remains at large.\n\nMexico has been mired for 12 years in a deadly military-led war against drug gangs. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was elected last year after promising a change, suggesting a negotiated peace and amnesty for non-violent drug dealers, traffickers and farmers.\n\nThe most detailed evidence against Guzman came from more than a dozen former associates who struck deals to cooperate with US prosecutors.\n\nThrough them, jurors heard how the Sinaloa Cartel gained power amid the shifting allegiances of the Mexican drug trade in the 1990s, eventually coming to control almost the entire Pacific coast of Mexico.\n\nThey heard how Guzman made a name for himself in the 1980s as \"El Rapido\", the speedy one, by building cross-border tunnels that allowed him to move cocaine from Mexico into the US faster than anyone else.\n\nThe witnesses, who included some of Guzman's top lieutenants, a communications engineer and a one-time mistress, described how he built a sophisticated organisation reminiscent of a multinational corporation.\n\nThey described fleets of planes and boats, detailed accounting ledgers and an encrypted electronic communication system run through secret computer servers in Canada.\n\nA former bodyguard testified that he watched Guzman kill three rival drug cartel members, including one victim who he shot and then ordered to be buried even as he was still gasping for air.\n\nEstimates of how much money Guzman made from drugs vary.\n\nIn 2009, Forbes Magazine put him on its list of the world's richest people, with an estimated one billion dollars. It later dropped him from the list, saying it was too difficult to quantify his assets.\n\nThe US Justice Department said in 2017 it sought forfeiture of more than $14bn in drug proceeds and illicit profits from Guzman.\n\nThe trial also featured extensive testimony about corruption in Mexico, most of it involving bribes to law enforcement, military and local government officials so the cartel could carry out its day-to-day drug shipping operations undisturbed.\n\nThe most shocking allegation came from Guzman's former top aide Alex Cifuentes, who accused former Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto of taking a $100m bribe from Guzman. A spokesman for the ex-president has denied the claim.\n\nIn one of the trial's final days, Guzman told the judge he would not testify in his own defence.\n\nThe same day, he grinned broadly at audience member Alejandro Edda, the Mexican actor who plays Guzman in the Netflix drama \"Narcos\".\n\nDespite his ties to government officials, Guzman often lived on the run.\n\nImprisoned in Mexico in 1993, he escaped in 2001 hidden in a laundry cart and spent the following years moving from one hideout to another in the mountains of Sinaloa, guarded by a private army.\n\nHe was seized and imprisoned again in 2014, but pulled off his best-known escape the following year when he disappeared into a tunnel dug into his cell in a maximum security prison.\n\nBut the Mexican government says he blew his cover through a series of slip-ups, including an attempt to make a movie about his life.\n\nHe was finally recaptured in January 2016 following a shoot-out in Sinaloa.",

         "Portugal police officers sentenced in unprecedented trial",
         "Lisbon, Portugal - Eight police officers were on Monday convicted of crimes ranging from aggravated kidnapping to grievous bodily harm against eight young black people in Lisbon.\n\nIt was the end - for now at least - of an unprecedented court case which saw seventeen agents on trial, bringing the issue of institutional racism and police violence in Portugal into the public eye. The sentences handed out, however, met disappointment, with both sides intending to appeal.\n\nThe case was brought against PSP (Portuguese, public-facing) police officers by the Public Ministry, and concerned the events of February 5, 2015, when police carried out an operation in Cova da Moura, a Lisbon neighbourhood known for its proud, predominantly Cape Verdean community. Two women, Neuza Correia and Jailsa Sousa - both bystanders - were left wounded after being shot with rubber-coated ammunition.\n\nA series of police detentions during the operation were on Monday found to have been illegal, tantamount to aggravated kidnapping, and resulting in the grievous bodily harm of a further six people - Bruno Lopes, Rui Moniz, Celso Lopes, Flavio Almada, Paulo Veiga and Miguel Reis.\n\nDuring the trial, it also emerged that police officers had falsified documentation and testimony in attempt to justify the detentions, alleging that the victims had been trying to \"storm\" the police station. While illegally detained, victims incurred injuries from broken bones to missing teeth. One was denied medication for a heart condition, the court heard.\n\nIn April, the Public Ministry dropped the accusation of \"racial hatred\", as well as an accusation of torture, in what was seen as a blow to the victims' case, which contained reports of repeated racial slurs and insults. All of the police officers in the case are white, and all of the defendants are black; however, racism is not a prosecutable criminal offence in Portugal.\n\n\"The kind of discrimination they face every day because they're poor and from working-class communities, because they're black, because they work on the informal market, and so on - all of the prejudice they face in the streets, they also experienced, unfortunately, within the courtroom,\" Lucia Gomes, the victims' lawyer, told Al Jazeera.\n\nMonday's court session - the 34th since the trial got under way - began tensely, with at least 30 of the tiny courtroom's seats occupied quickly by off-duty police officers and police union reps, almost all of them men, who had been filling the corridors before the session began. That left only three seats for the victims. Their family and supporters - including the NGO SOS Racism - were forced to wait outside. When Judge Ester Pacheco entered the courtroom to read her final decision, there were only four black faces in the courtroom, including two of the victims - Flavio Almada and Celso Lopes - and their lawyer, Jose Semedo Fernandes.\n\nJudge Pacheco ruled that only one police officer would serve a prison sentence - of one year and six months - because he was already under a suspended sentence. The remaining seven convicted officers were given suspended prison sentences of between two months and five years, with the police station chief Luís Anunciacao receiving the longest sentence. The judge rejected the police officers' version of events almost in its entirety, referring in detail to the Police Code and to the Portuguese constitution to make her points about professionalism and human rights.\n\nHowever, it was the awarding of substantial compensation to the victims - which some officers will have to pay - that caused the most upset in the courtroom. Six of the victims were awarded payouts of around 10,000 euros ($11,160). Anunciacao received the largest bill, having been ordered to pay 50,000 euros ($55,780) to the victims.\n\nThere were emotional scenes outside the courtroom as some victims and supporters cautiously celebrated a small but significant victory. Lawyer Lucia Gomes was clearly relieved yet reserved in her reaction: \"I can't say that I'm happy,\" she told Al Jazeera. \"The court had every possibility to go much further than it did.\"\n\nOn social media, prominent members of Portuguese anti-racism movements denounced the sentences as \"shameful\" and \"pitiful\".\n\n\"The fact that organised Black movements have emerged onto the public sphere in recent years may explain the small victory of today,\" Pedro Schacht Pereira, an associate professor of Portuguese at the Ohio State University, told Al Jazeera. \"It is a ruling that gives an air of decency to the justice system, while preserving intact the idea that racism is not a Portuguese problem, since those charges were dropped.\"\n\n\"It's bittersweet,\" said SOS Racism director Mamadou Ba after the session, calling the sentences \"disproportionate\" to the crimes committed. \"Furthermore, the u-turn that the Public Ministry performed [on the charges of racism and torture] pose a serious challenge in the fight against institutional racism.\"\n\nThe seventeen police officers were greeted with applause as they left the court building in Sintra - but many of them looked shaken. At least two have already made denouncements of slander against some of the victims. Peixoto Rodrigues, a police union leader, said they intended to appeal: \"First, we're going to analyse the decision that's been made.\"\n\nThe sentencing comes a year since the trial began - and more than four years after the events it dealt with. \"I think they got off lightly,\" Flavio Almada told reporters outside the courthouse. \"Our families, our friends, and our community have suffered greatly.\"",

         "Two priests and a gardener have appeared in court to face charges of sexually abusing deaf children in their care, in a case that has sent shockwaves through Argentina's Catholic church.\n\nPriests Nicola Corradi, an 83-year-old Italian, and 59-year-old Argentine Horacio Corbacho, as well as former gardener Armando Gomez, 63, are accused of sexual abuse, corruption of children and mistreatment at a Catholic school for deaf children.\n\nThey face prison sentences of up to 20 years in some cases, up to 50 years in others.\n\nThe case relates to the abuse of around 20 children from the Provolo Institute in the western town of Mendoza. Corradi headed the institute, founded in 1995, until his arrest in November 2016.\n\nAs the three accused - Corbacho and Gomez in handcuffs - were led down a long corridor in Mendoza's Palace of Justice on Monday to a court where three judges awaited them, alleged victims and their relatives protested outside, with one sign saying \"With Our Hands And Our Voices We Break The Silence,\" a reference to sign language.\n\n\"I am super-nervous, anxious and I hope for justice; that this ends soon so my son can move on to a new stage because this is very hard,\" said Natalia Villalonga, whose 18-year-old son Ezequiel was one of the students abused at the Provolo Institute.\n\nThe alleged abuse took place between 2004 and 2016, and the case gained world attention when it emerged that Corradi had faced similar accusations at the Antonio Provolo Institute in Verona, Italy, and Pope Francis had been notified the Italian priest was running a similar centre in Argentina.\n\nCorbacho has pleaded not guilty to the sexual abuse charges, while Corradi and Gomez have not entered pleas.\n\nThe closed-doors trial, expected to last two months, will hear testimony from 13 victims who suffered abuse between the ages of four and 17.\n\nIt is the first in a series of trials involving other former members of the now-closed school.\n\nOthers implicated include two nuns who allegedly participated or knew about the abuses, as well as former directors and employees who are accused of knowing about the abuse but taking no action.\n\nJorge Bordon, an institute employee, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2018 in a case of rape, sexual touching and corrupting minors.\n\nCorradi moved to Argentina in 1970 from the original Provolo Institute in Verona - which has also been shaken by a paedophilia scandal in recent years - to run the Provolo in La Plata, before transferring to the Mendoza institute in 1998.\n\nHis name appeared in a letter addressed to the pope in 2014 in which the Italian accusers mentioned several allegedly abusive priests who continued to exercise the ministry and said that Corradi and three other priests were in Argentina.\n\nThe Verona diocese sanctioned four of the 24 defendants, but not Corradi.\n\nThere was no criminal case because of the elapsed time.",

Later in the first hour, we’ll connect with journalist Vanessa Beeley to discuss the incredible events in Paris over the weekend, as the Gilet Jaunes aka ‘Yellow Vests,’ draw even more blood at the hands of the Macron regime, pushing protests into their 12th consecutive week – and with no sign of abating. What will happen next? In the final hour, we’ll look at Basil’s Magic Roundabout, to see who’s on and who’s off this week, as well as a special tribute to one of music’s great performers. All this and so much more. Enjoy the show…\n\nHELP US KEEP DOING WHAT WE DO: DONATE TO 21WIRE\n\n*NOTE: THIS EPISODE MAY CONTAIN STRONG LANGUAGE AND MATURE THEMES*",

We’ll also review the current situation in Syria after this week’s talks in Sochi, and Trump’s threat to release 800 of his ISIS fighters if Europe won’t take them into ‘custody’ (social services), and the collapse of the west’s “chemical attack” narrative from #Douma Syria last April. Also, what we can expect in Venezuela following the Pence-Abrams-Bolton’s folly of coup and whether their puppet Juan Guaido can hold on much longer before he’s replaced by a new puppet.

In the first hour we’ll discuss the week’s regime change circus in Venezuela, as the wheels come of Washington’s NeoCon folly, a cowboy operation which is looking more like ‘Maidan on Meth, led by a motley cast of white collar (and nosed) criminals led by the US Senate’s own Tony Montana, Little Marco Rubio, and PNAC pensioner John ‘The Walrus’ Bolton, and Virgin billionaire Richard ‘Stripe’ Branson – hoping to hoist this week’s CIA-backed puppet Juan Guaido on to the Neoliberal throne in Caracas. We’ll also run through the top #FakeNews and Agent Provocateur stunts being churned out by the mainstream media, designed to intentionally deceive not just US audiences, but the global population – in order to build the case for western intervention in South America. In the final hour, we’ll take a spin around Basil’s Magic Roundabout, with the Sunday Wire’s roving correspondent for Culture & Sport, Basil Valentine, to see who’s on and who’s off this week: Tony Blair’s attempt Labour Party coup could be a flop spawned from the contrived crisis of “Antisemitism in the Labour Party”, and across the pond the Democratic 2020 field is withering already and looks to degrade even further as Bernie Sanders jumped on the NeoCon regome change bandwagon with Venezuela.

         "Elodie Kulik was heading home from a restaurant in January 2002 when she was abducted, raped and then murdered.\n\nA 24-year-old bank manager working in the northern French town of Péronne, her car was targeted in an ambush and as she tried to call emergency services she was dragged from her vehicle.\n\nDespite a huge inquiry, no arrests were made and the trail then went cold.\n\nNow, after a relentless campaign by her father and ingenious use of DNA, a man has gone on trial 17 years later.\n\nWilly Bardon, 45, denies kidnapping, rape and murder and sat beside his lawyer as the trial got under way at a court in Amiens.\n\nElodie's father, Jacky Kulik, arrived early for Thursday's trial. He lost his first two children in a car accident when they were five and six years old. His wife died in 2011 after trying to take her life and ending up in a coma.\n\nCameras were allowed in the court as the judges arrived.\n\nWhy it took so long\n\nThe Elodie Kulik murder case went cold for a decade, until advances in DNA helped identify one of her attackers.\n\nThe victim's body was found by a farmer on 12 January 2002 on a disused airbase. What was found at the crime scene gave investigators evidence they were able to use 10 years later - even though it was unusable at the time.\n\nElodie had been partly burned by her killers. Traces of semen were found in a condom along with four sets of incomplete DNA and a fingerprint.\n\nWhile police interviewed 10,000 people and analysed 14,000 phone records, the DNA samples they had gathered failed to come up with a match on the national crime database. There was no broader DNA database at the time and the samples did not match anyone tested as part of the inquiry.\n\nIn January 2011, a gendarmerie captain, Emmanuel Pham-Hoai, came up with the idea of using a technique tried out in Wales and in the US but never before in France.\n\nInstead of looking for a direct DNA match he searched for similar matches that might indicate a relative within the system - known as familial DNA searching.\n• How familial DNA trapped a murderer for the first time\n\nWithin days, the DNA from the condom matched a man already in prison. Detectives told Le Monde newspaper how they then approached his wife and were able to confirm that the sample matched their children.\n\nThey narrowed down their search to Grégory Wiart, a heating engineer who had died in a car accident in 2003. His body was exhumed and police then said they were sure he was one of the killers.\n\nShortly afterwards police detained seven members of the same family, including Willy Bardon, the man on trial. He originally came from the same village as Wiart.\n\nMr Bardon was charged after his voice was linked to the phone call made by Elodie Kulik to the emergency services. Male voices had been audible in the background and police say when they played the tape to Wiart's relatives, five of them recognised his voice.\n\nThe defendant denies the voice was his. One of his lawyers, Stéphane Daquo, told AFP news agency this was \"the only trial where everyone who has their DNA at the scene of the crime is a witness and the only one who doesn't is accused\".\n\nMore on DNA and rape:",

         "A new art exhibit explores Thomas Jefferson's highly influential architectural ideas and his vision for structures that symbolize liberty and democracy.\n\nBut the exhibit also strives to spotlight some of the enslaved workers who helped construct many of the buildings that Jefferson designed.\n\nThe exhibit opens Saturday at the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk, Virginia. The show offers another reckoning over the founding father's legacy and the role of enslaved Americans in U.S. history.\n\nExhibit curator Erik Neil says Jefferson envisioned buildings for a new republic, not old-world kings. The domes and columns in his designs purposefully recalled ancient Greece and Rome.\n\nBut he said it's impossible to talk about Jefferson without talking about the issue of slavery and race in America.",

         "TV comedy greats take a bow, make ’em laugh at ceremony",
         "“There’s nothing I believe more than this, that laughter adds time to one’s life,” Norman Lear told an audience gathered to honor him and other four other television comedy greats.\n\n“I believe that as much as I believe my mother loved me,” the writer-producer added. “She said she did. But I wasn’t sure.”\n\nLike the 97-year-old Lear, who made his name — and TV history — with groundbreaking sitcoms like “All in the Family” and “The Jeffersons,” the other honorees at Thursday’s Paley Center for Media ceremony proved that talent is ageless. Carl Reiner, 97; Bob Newhart, 90; Carol Burnett, 86, and Lily Tomlin, 80, each won over the room with their humor and memories.\n\n“Guess this is a hell of a time to tell you no, we’re not coming to your Christmas party,” Newhart teased Conan O’Brien after the late-night host introduced him as “one of my all-time comedy heroes.”\n\n“He pulls off the hardest kind of comedy — timeless, human, clean and subversive. And he makes it all look effortless,” O’Brien said of Newhart.\n\nThe onetime accountant became an instant sensation in 1960 with his debut album, the Grammy-winning “The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart,” scored sitcom hits with “The Bob Newhart Show” in the 1970s and “Newhart” in the ’80s and won an Emmy as Professor Proton on “The Big Bang Theory.”\n\nThe sentimental moments included Rob Reiner’s introduction of his father, the writer-actor-producer whose TV career stretched from the 1950s variety series “Caesar’s Hour” to creating “The Dick Van Dyke Show” to a recent role in “Angie Tribeca.”\n\n“This is the nicest thing, to be able to do this for my dad,” said the younger Reiner, who gave him an arm for support as they walked onto the hotel ballroom stage at The Paley Honors: A Special Tribute to Television’s Comedy Legends.\n\nCarl Reiner, who credited a government-supported acting program with his childhood start in entertainment, charmed the audience by reciting lines from a Shakespeare soliloquy he learned as a kid and sharing an anecdote about another TV comedy force, Jack Benny. He called his children and grandchildren his greatest pride.\n\nCarol Burnett was introduced by Kristin Chenoweth, who lauded the singer-actress-comedian as one of the few who can do it all and always “with such heart.”\n\nBurnett, who starred on Broadway, as well as TV, recalled what preceded the 1967 arrival of “The Carol Burnett Show.”\n\n“As a woman in this business, it wasn’t always easy to do what the naysayers said couldn’t be done,” she said. When she sought to exercise a contract clause with CBS for an hour-long variety show, Burnett said executives told her, “and I quote, ‘It’s not for you gals.’”\n\nShe punctuated the story with a derisive “huh.” Her long-running show won armloads of Emmy Awards on CBS.\n\nTomlin, whose parade of characters made her a hit on “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In” and who stars opposite Jane Fonda on “Grace and Frankie,” was self-effacing, saying she couldn’t match Newhart’s “sterling one-liners.” Instead, she delighted the audience by reciting some of her characters’ catchphrases, including telephone operator Ernestine’s “one ringy dingy.”\n\n“I’m so grateful for this great, great honor,” Tomlin said.\n\nLear was introduced by “black-ish” star Anthony Anderson, who said Lear’s work forced audiences to confront difficult issues while shedding light on common bonds, and by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, who said the producer used laughter to challenge “us to make progress.”\n\nThe night’s last word went to Lear.\n\n“Bless you all, thank you all. To be continued,” he said, smiling.\n\nLynn Elber can be reached at lelber@ap.org and on Twitter at http://twitter.com/lynnelber\n\nThis story has been corrected to quote Norman Lear as saying “Bless you, thank you all. To be continued,” not “Bless you all, thank you. Let me continue.”",

         "Several musicians and festivals are coming together to call to an end to concert promoters using facial recognition at venues and music festivals, Vice News reported.\n\nLast year Live Nation announced it would begin deploying facial recognition at its concerts. The event organizer stated they would start having customers walk past facial recognition cameras instead of presenting their tickets, a horrifying first step for indoctrinating the public towards using the technology.\n\nThis has spurred Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine, Glitch Mob’s Speedy Ortiz, and a growing number of dozens of other artists and festivals to team up with digital rights activist group, Fight For the Future, in a campaign.\n\nThe campaign aims to call out Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, as well as other venues for using facial recognition on concert goers.\n\nThe group of artists cite “dangers to their fans in the form of police harassment including — misidentification, deportation, arrests for outstanding charges during an event and drug use during an event, discrimination at their concerts, and fans in a permanent government database,” all very valid concerns.\n\nThe other major concern by this writer that was left off the web page, is the technology would effectively turn every single person into a product, by venues and partner brands knowing what type of music each person likes. This could be abused in a variety of different ways including targeted advertising of groups of fans who like a certain genre of music, as well as email spam of up and coming concerts that a “fan” might like to see and hear.\n\nLately, BIG brother has been pushing the use of surveillance technology, from Amazon helping law enforcement with its Facial Rekogntion software, DHS wanting to use it for border control, to the Olympics wanting to use the tech for security.\n\nEven retail is pushing for the technology as an anti-theft mechanism to be introduced in a thousands of stores using biometric facial recognition software FaceFirst to build a database of shoplifters, as Activist Post reported.\n\nSome of the biggest airports in the country — estimated at 16 airports across the U.S. — are now scanning us as we board international flights. While CBP (Customs And Border Patrol) expects to scale up the program to cover more than 97 percent of passengers flying outside of the U.S. by 2021 according to NextGov.\n\nIts all a part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s “Biometric exit” agenda, which was originally signed into law under the Obama administration, BuzzFeed News reported.\n\nFurther, the policy director of U.S. CBP believes that facial recognition has already become essential. The agency’s head Deputy Executive Assistant Commissioner John Wagner has also hilariously said that its facial tracking technology isn’t surveillance, as Activist Post reported.\n\nIn 2017, Homeland Security clarified their position on domestic spying stating Americans who don’t want faces scanned leaving the country “shouldn’t travel.”\n\n“The only way for an individual to ensure he or she is not subject to collection of biometric information when traveling internationally is to refrain from traveling,” the DHS wrote in a document.\n\nThe NYPD adopted facial recognition technology eight years ago and dozens of other police departments have followed suit.\n\nThe campaign website against using the technology at concerts reads:\n\nWhat can you do to stop this? According to the website, make some noise using social media, tweet at artists and click here for emails to top festivals/venues voicing your concerns demanding they don’t support the use of facial recognition.\n\nHere’s the default tweet, feel free to customize it a bit and make it unique while standing up for your rights with the hashtag: #BanFacialRecognition.\n\nMany likely laughed about the paranoid nature this writer has expressed when it comes to facial recognition technology; however, vindication came swiftly recently when Amazon announced it wanted to create a “Crime News Network” to monitor neighborhoods with its Ring doorbell facial recognition cameras. At this point, they are literally just creating George Orwell’s 1984 or reinventing the Stasi.\n\nThe fight against facial recognition is just beginning, and this writer has been one of many attempting to champion that effort for years now. Don’t believe that we have already lost the battle, just because more and more facial recognition companies have been popping up. Doesn’t mean that we can’t stop the attempted nightmarish era of mass surveillance by the state and private companies.\n\nAlready, we have had several wins in this long fight and there are signs of hope. First, San Francisco banned facial recognition technology being used by the government in May of this year, then Somerville, Massachusetts, and Oakland, California followed suit.\n\nThe rapid growth of this technology has triggered a much-needed debate to slow down the roll out. Activists, politicians, academics and even police forces are expressing serious concerns over the impact facial recognition could have on our society.\n\nSeveral lawmakers have even chimed in to voice concerns about Amazon’s facial recognition software, expressing worry that it could be misused, The Hill reported.\n\nA Senate bill introduced in March would force companies who want to use facial recognition technology on consumers to first get their consent. If that happens as soon as the ink is dry Amazon’s Ring and Amazon’s Facial Rekognition which heavily relies on facial recognition technology could be banned across the U.S.\n\nCongress under the House Oversight Committee recently held a bipartisan discussion on the issue of regulating the use of facial recognition technology and biometric cameras.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said, “there are virtually no controls …. Whatever walk of life you come from, you may be a part of this [surveillance] process.”\n\nThe committee’s top Republican Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio.) also expressed “It’s time for a time out” on government use of the surveillance technology.\n\nPrivacy advocate groups, attorneys, and even more recently Microsoft, which also markets its own facial recognition system, have all raised concerns over the technology, pointing to issues of consent, racial profiling, and the potential to use images gathered through facial recognition cameras as evidence of criminal guilt by law enforcement.",

         "Iran artist puts spotlight on water shortage through music",
         "Images of glowing light danced to a slow electronic beat, as an indistinguishable instrument radiated sound resembling flowing water.\n\nNo more than 100 people sat down in the darkened cavern in the northwest Iranian city of Qazvin, while listening to the tune played by the electronic musician, Saba Alizadeh, who came up with the idea to highlight the ongoing water shortage in Iran.\n\nA century ago, it would have been impossible for the artist to entertain his audience there. The facility, common across pre-modern Iran, was originally built to store drinking water underground for local residents in Qazvin, 140km northwest of the capital Tehran.\n\nBut for years now, most of these reservoirs have dried up, turning the structures into relics of Iran's past.\n\nThe brick-lined water reservoir, known as Ab-Anbar in Persian, is covered with a dome, protecting the stored water from evaporation and contamination. It is connected to a wind tower, known as badgir, which serves as a natural cooler of the water inside.\n\nThese reservoirs were so important to life, particularly in the desert areas, that they became integrated into communities in arid regions of the country.\n\nAlizadeh, the musician, saw an opportunity to revisit these architectural icons, in an effort to raise awareness about the country's water crisis.\n\n\"Metaphorically speaking, the concerts were a recollection of the water that did not exist there in the reservoirs any more,\" Alizadeh told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"It is supposed to sound the alarm, reminding Iranians that in a place which used to be a depot for water, now there is only dirt.\"\n\nRecently, the research arm of the Iranian parliament warned that water shortage in the country could lead to social discontent. It added that by 2020, up to 80 percent of Iran's more than 80 million people could face water scarcity.\n\nSo far, Alizadeh has performed his show, Elegy for Water, at reservoirs in the cities of Qazvin, Kerman and Shiraz. The 35-year-old musician plans to do more events in Kashan, Yazd and Isfahan, cities that in recent years have faced water shortages.\n\nThe water problem in these major cities has been exacerbated by poor infrastructures and government policies.\n\nAbout 35 million Iranians, a little less than half of the total population, living across 334 cities faced water shortage during the summer of 2018, according to Iran's Minister of Energy Reza Ardakanian.\n\nLack of awareness about the issue has further added to the problem.\n\n\"We are facing a severe drought ... We don't seem to pay attention to the things that are happening in this regard,\" Alizadeh said.\n\n\"Perhaps this tour could be a very small gesture to remind people of water; so that they could appreciate it a bit more,\" he said, referring to the wastage of water in the country.\n\nAlizadeh came up with the idea of the musical piece in 2012, when he started to study music at the California Institute for Arts, after he finished his bachelor's degree in photography in Iran. It was only much later, when he decided to perform the piece at dried-up cisterns to highlight the growing water problem.\n\nThe musician uses Zanjeer - which is made of small chains hanging off a wooden handle - as a source for musical notes.\n\nZanjeer is mostly used during annual Ashura commemorations by Shia Muslims, who hit their bodies with the object to mourn the death of their third Imam.\n\nAlizadeh installed a microphone at the end of Zanjeer's handle to capture the granular sound made by the movement of the chains.\n\nThe rattling of the chains is then processed by a computer to become a sound that is reminiscent of that of flowing water.\n\n\"I wrote the harmonies within the sound of the water,\" he explained.\n\nThe initial piece was completed with an overture that he wrote recently, turning Elegy for Water into a 40-45 minute-long musical number.\n\nThe performance includes visuals created by artist Siavash Naghshbandi, who collaborated on the project. The images were an artistic perception of the reflections of water. They were projected on the walls of the water cisterns.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Naghshbandi referred to the \"mysterious\" quality of the forms that the flow of the water creates; as well as the irony of watching those visuals in a dried-up cistern.\n\n\"The images were projected on the ceiling. It was as if you saw the reflections of the water when you take a look above, knowing there is no water in the reservoir,\" he said.\n\nRoshanka Sajadian, a Tehran-based architect, took a two-hour road trip to Qazvin to watch the show.\n\n\"The combination of the concept, the music and the location turned this into a curious event,\" she told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"It was as if I was nailed to my chair, wiping tears off my face as the music rose to a crescendo.\"\n\nAndreas Spechtl, an Austrian musician who collaborated with Alizadeh on the project, told Al Jazeera that the artist is \"mourning the loss of water, while treating a highly traditional and religious device, Zanjeer, as an electronic instrument.\"\n\n\"One could call it conceptual art. But it's not that easy, because there are no answers and no great solutions in his work. He is not making a big case. No. He's now and then dropping a question. And that's the noblest thing you can say about art.\"",

         "St. Louis, KC seek tougher gun laws amid violence uptick",
         "A bill requiring St. Louis gun dealers to alert police when a firearms purchase is denied because of a criminal background check is the latest step in addressing violence in a city beset by gun crimes.\n\nSt. Louis aldermen unanimously gave final approval to the bill Friday. Supporters say 30% of criminals who try to purchase guns but fail to do so because of background checks are arrested within five years. The bill awaits Democratic Mayor Lyda Krewson's signature.\n\nMissouri's big cities, St. Louis and Kansas City, have among the highest homicide rates in the nation. Both are seeking to address the problem through tougher local gun laws since statewide legislation is unlikely in the conservative-led state, where Republican Gov. Mike Parson has pledged \"to protect the rights of the Second Amendment for law-abiding citizens.\"\n\nA message left with Parson's office was not immediately returned Friday.\n\nIn St. Louis, where Parson assigned highway patrol officers to help fight crime in September, the situation is made more tragic by the fact that 13 of those killed in shootings this year were children, all of them black.\n\nSt. Louis aldermanic President Lewis Reed said the city law will help alert police to people with criminal records who are seeking guns.\n\n\"This is one more piece to the puzzle, and it's an important piece,\" Reed said. \"We're no longer going to wait for the state to do the right thing, or the federal government to do the right thing.\"\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if the attorney general's office in Missouri would challenge the law on grounds that it conflicts with state law. A spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schmitt declined comment, saying the office had not seen details.\n\nAnother St. Louis measure under consideration would designate the city's parks as child care facilities so they're exempt from a Missouri law allowing people to carry concealed firearms without permits and training. Signs explaining the gun prohibition would be posted at park entrances, parking areas, playgrounds and sports fields. Several St. Louis killings have happened at parks or near them.\n\nChild cares, churches, hospitals and some other places can ban the carrying of guns under state law. But parks are not on the list.\n\nIn Kansas City, the City Council approved two laws aimed at keeping guns away from children. One of the laws, passed in August, makes it a local offense for minors to have handguns. The other prohibits adults from recklessly giving minors guns without their parents' permission.\n\nLast week, Democratic Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas proposed an ordinance that would allow police to take firearms from domestic violence offenders or those who are the subject of restraining orders. A similar federal law exists but backers say a local law would help police and prosecutors pursue the cases.\n\nSt. Louis has had 165 homicides in 2019 and is on pace to top last year's total of 186. In Kansas City, 122 homicides have occurred this year, and the city is on pace to top last year's 138 killings.",

         "Prosecutors charge man with hate crime in acid attack",
         "A 61-year-old white Milwaukee man accused of throwing acid on a Hispanic man's face will be charged with a hate crime, increasing the possible sentence he may receive if convicted, prosecutors announced Wednesday.\n\nProsecutors filed one charge against Clifton Blackwell — first-degree reckless injury — but added the sentencing enhancers of hate crime and use of a dangerous weapon. The two enhancers could add 10 years in prison if he's convicted of first-degree reckless injury, which is punishable by up to 25 years.\n\nThe victim, Mahud Villalaz, 42, said his attacker approached him near a restaurant Friday night and confronted him about being parked too close to a bus stop, according to charging documents. Prosecutors said Blackwell then asked, \"Why did you invade my country?\" and \"Why don't you respect my laws?\"\n\nVillalaz said he moved his car but that Blackwell continued to berate him, calling him \"illegal\" and telling him to \"go back, go back,\" followed by an expletive. Villalaz said he called Blackwell a racist, also using an expletive. Villalaz said Blackwell threw the acid on him after Villalaz said \"everyone come from somewhere first\" and that American Indians had been in the country the longest.\n\nSurveillance video from the restaurant recorded the attack, which left Villalaz with second-degree burns on his face.\n\nVillalaz is a U.S. citizen who immigrated from Peru.\n\nBlackwell made his first court appearance Wednesday to be advised of the charges he faces. Bond was set at $20,000 but it's on the condition he wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. He's still being held at the Milwaukee County jail and his public defender did not immediately return a call.\n\nThe attack on Villalaz comes at a time when the Anti-Defamation League says extreme anti-immigrant views have become part of the political mainstream in recent years through sharp rhetoric by anti-immigration groups and politicians, including President Donald Trump.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said Monday that the Trump administration has repeatedly condemned racism and violence.\n\nInvestigators who searched Blackwell's home found among other things four bottles of sulfuric acid, muriatic acid, and two bottles of Kleen-Out drain opener that was 100 % lye, according to the search warrant. Additional conditions for his bond are that he have no contact with acids or large batteries, or possess dangerous weapons or firearms. His next court appearance is Nov. 15.\n\nBefore filing the charge, Milwaukee District Attorney John Chisholm said during an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio that his office was looking to determine whether the attack was motivated \"in whole or in part\" based on the victim's race. He said prosecutors would look \"very closely first at the underlying offenses and then we'll make a determination whether the facts support the hate crime.\"\n\n\"But it's obviously a concern to many people not just in this community but really around the country right now,\" he said.\n\nJust as Blackwell was in court, Villalaz spoke briefly to reporters to say he was pleased with the charges and thankful for \"the people that have worried about me.\" He said Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin called him to say she was \"very sad\" about what happened and offered to help however she can.\n\nHis mother, Jacqueline P. Blackwell, of California, told the Journal Sentinel he had sought care with the Department of Veterans Affairs in Milwaukee for post-traumatic stress.\n\n\"I was comfortable that he was getting good care with the VA,\" she told the newspaper.\n\nHis brother, Arthur Eugene Blackwell of Evergreen, Colorado, told the AP that Clifton served nearly four years in the U.S. Marines and was stationed at the Panama Canal around the time Manuel Noriega was captured and removed in 1990. A Marine official told AP that the branch doesn't have a record matching Blackwell's name and birthdate.\n\nState court records show Blackwell was convicted in a 2006 Rusk County case of false imprisonment and pointing a gun at a person in a case where he held four hunters at gunpoint because they were on his property.",

         "A Connecticut judge has dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit against a flight school and its owner over a 2016 plane crash that killed a student pilot.\n\nJudge Matthew Budzik in Hartford ruled in favor of Arian Prevalla and his now-defunct American Flight Academy on Friday.\n\nPrevalla survived the small plane crash in East Hartford. He accused the student pilot, Feras Freitekh, of intentionally crashing the plane.\n\nFreitekh's father denied Prevalla's allegations and filed a lawsuit alleging there was a defect with the plane or Prevalla failed to take control of it before it crashed.\n\nPrevalla argued the lawsuit should be dismissed because the lawyer for Freitekh's father, Michael Peck, could not identify expert witnesses who could help prove his case.\n\nPeck said Monday he is deciding whether to appeal.",
